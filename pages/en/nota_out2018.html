		<h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">My sincere Thanks to you</h1><br>
		<h4>
			I want to start this note with thanks to all the people who have provided their support to my channel. I always like to point out that, as an independent content producer, it is hard to keep a direct contact with all of you at first. For this reason, I would like to thank you for you stopping by in my <a href="http://bit.ly/vonSchapplerTwitch" target="_blank">channel</a> to watch my streams which are prepared with great affection for all of you, bringing entertainment and reliving some old titles that have been forgotten by many .<br>
			Today (Sep/28/2018) our <span class="ui purple label">Twitch</span> channel has 41 followers, indicating that we are very close to the first level of partnership also known as <span class="ui label purple">Affiliate</span>. This is a great achievement for the channel, since we are growing little by little. Conclusion: here is my

			to you who are part of our community and I always hope to count on your support to grow more and make our community an active community.<br>
			I want to remind everyone that for the growth of our community, it is important that you always participate in our streams whenever possible by calling your friends and colleagues to join us, as well as maintaining the goal of <span class="ui teal label">50 followers</span> and <span class="ui teal label">3+ viewers</span> during the stream session!

		<div class="ui divider"></div>
		<h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">What's new?</h1><br>
		<h4>
			We are slowly creating new things for the channel as a way to keep our community active. Among these we are implementing system of currency in the channel. So far, this system is under test, but can be accessed in the chat through the command <span class="ui label teal">!vscoins</span>.<br>
			In the future, with these coins you can participate in activities such as:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Giveaways - events promoted to reward viewers;</li>
				<li>Minigames - minigames as <span class="ui teal label">!heist</span> and <span class="ui teal label">!duel</span> are being implemented for your enjoyment during lives;</li>
				<li>Bets - when promoted you can increase your vscoins for use in other activities;</li>
				<li>Opportunities to join my game sessions, when applicable.</li>
			</ul>
			Much more is coming to improve our interactivity! To know what is already available in our list of commands <a href="http://bit.ly/botCommands" target="_blank">click here</a>.

		<h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">About the YouTube Channel</h1><br>
		<h4>
			I had scheduled the return to <span class="ui red label">YouTube</span> in September, with pre-recorded gameplays of <span class="ui teal label">Bayonetta</span> e <span class="ui teal label">Doom (2016)</span>. These plans have unfortunately not been implemented, for several reasons that should not be stated here. In contrast, this channel will remain active, but its current function will be to store and publish the live sessions in full. The way these videos will be uploaded / published is still under review, but I will keep you posted when something new happens there.<br>
			So far, I'm developing a basic script that I will use in my videos, as well as working on creating elements that will be used specifically for pre-recorded videos when they are re-released.<br>
			The contents/format of the pre-recorded videos which will to be recorded are still being planned. If you have any suggestions, feel free to contact me at my <a href="mailto:vonschappler.gaming@gmail.com?subject=YouTube Suggestions">e-mail</a> so we can work together to make something that please everyone!

		<h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">Halloween Event</h1><br>
		<h4>
			I am working on a specific Halloween event, bringing in a different game on days that I do not normally do. For more information about the Halloween event, check the updated calendar for October!<br>
			Just keep in mind that I'll stream an extra game series, <span class="ui teal label">F.E.A.R. - Trilogy</span>, where I'll be challenging myself to make a playthrough in the game's most extreme difficulty mode.<br>
			Are you wondering why this game? Who knows F.E.A.R., understands why. Who does not know, just follow the streams of F.E.A.R. to understand the reason for the choice.
		</h4>
		<h3 align="center">NOTE: Although I played the first game of this trilogy, I have no idea what to expect from the other games in the series.</h3>

		<h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">Mixer Streams</h1><br>
		<h4>
			For the time being, <span class="ui blue label">Mixer</span> streams will be remodeled so at November we can work on a project specifically for that platform. That said, during this month (October), I'll just stream on <span class="ui purple label">Twitch</span>.<br>
			Although there is the possibility of multiplatform streaming by the Restream application, I am focusing ONLY on one of several existing platforms.
		</h4>
		<div class="ui divider"></div>
		<h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">Interface Changes</h1><br>
		<h4>
			Due to the launch of new features on the StreamLabs platform, I'm working on redesigning stream overlays so that you can bring extra elements and information to viewers. That said, small tweaks are under development and will be applied as needed. I hope that until in November everything is organized and this overlay redesign is able to present information that I judge important for viewers.
