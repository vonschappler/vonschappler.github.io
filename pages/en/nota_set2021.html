			It's been almost four long months without any updates for these notes... Yes I know I always am promising constant updates,
			but I can never make good on the promise. I realized that it has been difficult to maintain a constant flow of updates, when 
			you are an independent content producer and you have to do it yourself.<br>
			Because of that, I made an unofficial decision (until now) to not promise updates to the website, but do so when possible.
			There is a lot going on currently and these things have either been taking up my time or making me change my priorities.<br>
			I'm not going to say that I'm happy when I need to do these such things, not only because changes may trigger anxiety attacks,
			but also because I like to, at least, try to plan things in advance so I have a "<b>Plan B</b>", in case things get out of control.
			Unfortunately, since the pandemic came, it's not quite the that's been happening - and I've been caught off guard many times, of course,
			almost always with problems to solve and almost never with solutions to these (or other) problems.<br>
			As a result, I end up wearing myself out not only physically, but emotionally - something that worsens (a lot) my
			quality of life and reduces the little control I have over my mental health.<br>

		<h4>
			It's been about a year since I've chosen to assume publicly my condition (being autistic) as part of my life.
			There are many conceptual paradigms of what is or what is not autism, and many people are unaware of what
			it actually happens in the life of an adult diagnosed with autism.<br>
			You know, despite the fact that Brazilian's life can be described as "a life to get used to problems instead of solving it"
			(since most of the time, we solve a problem and only to get ten more later), it comes a time when individuals get tired
			of being judged by their behavior towards things, towards society, and acknowledge it is time to do something for themselves.
			With this in mind, I made this decision (expose publicity my mental health condition) hoping things will be different in the future.<br>
			I hope that someday these conceptual paradigms will be broken and that people will stop looking (not just at me,
			but at all other autistic people, regardless of their degree of autism) for who we really are. People with peculiar
			mental and social conditions, both in terms of cognitive learning and in terms of social behavior. I say this because I have
			my own choices "of things to do and how to do them" and most of the time I end up being judged for those choices. The difficulty
			in adapting to certain things suggested by others, makes me very stressed, and most of the time, this stress have made people go away
			from me. When they don't go away, they end staying close, but making judgments about things that are not part of my reality, but
			part of theirs, because they don't understand (or don't care about) what's going on inside my mind and/or in my life.<br>
			This is a very uncomfortable feeling and as much as I come to do something to ease this feeling,
			it seems that nothing has changed. Do you know that feeling of emptiness that sometimes some people can feel?
			Well, that's how I feel when these things happen to me. Needless to say, having people judging me and/or moving away from me,
			makes this emptiness feeling even worse.<br>
			As an autistic person, I have extreme difficulties in socializing - which is, by the way, a very common characteristic in
			every autistic person, regardless of the severity and/or level of autism, and "losing people" I still have as part of my social
			circle makes my social life even more complicated than it already is.<br>
			Apart from all that, there is the insistent search for recognition. Personal recognition and being recognized by others - 
			mainly family and relatives. I believe I've already talked about it, but I'll repeat it. To most people,  all I do is to pay pity
			over me only to "take advantage" of something. If my life depended on my relatives, it is possible that today I would be in a
			madhouse since I have tried several times to do things that "a normal person wouldn't do" - let's put it that way.<br>
			To be honest, I thought publicly acknowledging the fact that I'm autistic would change things for the better, personally and professionally.
			That's not what happened. That made things a lot worse, in my point of view, but I will not go back on that decision. There are those
			who don't like it when I say I am autistic. There are those who doubt that I'm autistic only because I don't look like one. And there
			is that small minority who doesn't care about that, understanding the situation and trying to help in whatever way he can. The
			fact is that each passing day, I look at the things that happened throughout that day and I realize that my fight (which wasn't easy)
			just gets even harder.<br>
			Despite the fact that "this autistic person here" has little empathy towards others, I've noticed that I have more empathy than
			many people out there, especially when I look to those that come for me only when they need my help. Well, they know I won't
			say no (as long as the help I can provide it's something within my reach), and that's because, unconsciously, helping is part of the
			"quest for recognition" and it ends in those people making profit of this.<br>
			Well, I won't go into detail about any of that here. I just used this little space as a venting moment, because, as I said, the emotional
			strain pushed over my is very high recently.

		<h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">... to then, talk about something else!</h1><br>
		<h4>
			I want to talk briefly (and then detail what needs and can be detailed) about things that happened recently. Due to the fact that
			my memory is a bit faulty, it is possible that one or another thing that will be commented/detailed here has already been mentioned
			in the "Informative Note for Jun/2021", but I don't care about repeating myself, in case this happens.<br>
		</h4>
		<h4 class="ui teal dividing header">1. General changes on my stream sessions:</h4>
		<h4>
			Without making an official publication on this website, I ended up making some changes regarding my streams. I usually
			make the announcement here and then start applying the changes, but as I said before, the lack of time forced me to reverse the
			order of this process a bit.<br><br>
			<span style="color: #16b2ab;">1.1. The "puppet" lookings:</span><br>
			I believe that those who followed the change process realized I changed the puppet model that I use as my "facecam".
			Although it's something more difficult to modify it for specials streams like the ones I usually do on commemorative dates
			(such as <b>Easter</b>, <b>Haloween</b>, <b>Christmas</b>, among others) is a model with more life and movement - besides
			it looks far way better on screen than the previous one.<br><br>
			<span style="color: #16b2ab;">1.2. Community Nights:</span><br>
			Another change I'm testing and implementing is a redesign of my "Community Nights". After a few unsuccessful "Community Nights"
			(at least in the way I expected), these special streams (which still happen once a month, still on the last Saturday of the month
			cycle) will now run inside my <a href="http://rebrand.ly/vonDiscord" target="_blank">Discord Server</a>. For these nights, the
			focus will be relaxing while watching the movie(s) chosen by community members. Depending on the duration of the chosen movie,
			it can be possible that more than one movie is featured per night. How will the process work? An example of how this will happen
			is best explained in the table below:<br>
			<table class="ui celled table">
				<thead class="center aligned">
					<tr>
						<th class="three column wide">Date</th>
						<th class="thirteen column wide">Event</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>09/12/2021</td>
						<td>Start of the poll to chose movies</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>09/25/2021</td>
						<td>End of the poll to chose movies</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>09/26/2021</td>
						<td>Announcement with the chose movies</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>10/02/2021</td>
						<td>Community Night - Watch Party</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			The process above will reapeat once per month, with dates announced on the channel "#updates", on the server.<br><br>
			<span style="color: #16b2ab;">1.3. Acquisition and selection of streamed games:</span><br>
			After the review I did on this site about the game Outriders, I really thought that using my focus in this game would be a good thing.<br>
			Things didn't go the way I had planned. Let's say the lack of in-game content, support ineffective by the developers, added
			to the various bugs (some of them seem like they never were fixed and will never be - by the way, I have a feeling they never
			noticed my humble messages mentioning some persistent bugs in the game) took part of my discouragement and lack of interest
			to continue creating content for that game.<br>
			Selecting a game to stream is no simple task. I've said a few times that I don't want to bring to my streams games I don't
			enjoy playing. But I'm also trying to think a little bit differently on the overall meaning of what I've been playing.
			I'm looking for games that not only give me pleasure to play but games that incite my curiosity and - of course - bring
			pleasure to those who are watching streams.<br>
			I also have to mention here that I have a decent collection of games, which has been expanded whenever possible. The motivation
			to bring variety to this community, whenever possible, makes me look for some new games to bring to the streams.<br>
			Thanks to advertising campaigns, community member's gifts, and giveaways, this collection growing bigger. This means that every
			now and then, as I've been doing in the past few months, I promote an advertising campaign delivery stream.<br>
			I recognize that I have not only to deliver those campaigns but also have to finish some unfinished games as a compromise
			to this community, including "Anima: Gate of Memories", "State of Mind", (fulfill the promise to attain all achievements
			during streams of) "Code Vein", among others.<br>
			I don't know when I'll be resuming these projects, but I've been doing some sporadic "State of Mind" streams when I need to
			relax because this game is really relaxing. As for the others, I really need to organize better my time and plan something
			different to do with them, but at the moment, these games are out of my best interest.<br><br>
			<span style="color: #16b2ab;">1.4. YouTube Channel updates:</span><br>
			It's been a while since I've posted anything new. Well, part of the reasons why there is no new content on my channel
			has already been explained - problems with the game I was using as a base, lack of time, etc. For these reasons, I need
			not only time but also creativity to start producing again content for that media.<br>
			I'm currently making gameplay recordings for the game "Visage" so I can edit and put it in the channel, but this type of
			content will follow the currently existing standard. The series of recordings are being made in the form of "live
			streams" that happen on Friday nights on my Discord Server. These recordings will be edited, for obvious reasons, to
			avoid platform restrictions when they are published on my channel.<br>
			Of course, in this editing process I'll do my best not to make unnecessary cuts, but why? I noticed that because the
			game is in early access, makes it have some bugs during the gameplay and
			these parts of the gameplay will need to be removed for sure in the process.<br>
			When the game is finished, I'll think of something and the channel will be with no content until I'm able to "pick a
			rabbit out of a hat".<br><br>

		<h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">Evento de Halloween (2021)</h1><br>
		<h4>
			Preparations for the special Halloween stream have been on going for a while. In addition to some off-stream work
			that I have done here to give a different look to my puppet, on 07/15/2021 I chose to start stream every the 
			"Resident Evil" game I own.<br>
			My goal is to play them all (trying to follow as best as possible the chronological order of events) so next
			to the Halloween, we can stream the latest game I own ("Resident Evil VII"). At the present time, this is my current progress:
			<table class="ui celled table">
				<thead class="center aligned">
					<tr>
						<th class="four column wide">Game</th>
						<th class="three column wide">Campaign</th>

						<td>1</td>

			<br>Therefore, I hope to continue this progress in the best way possible for this series to be completed by the end of
			October (or by the end of the first half of November) 2021.
