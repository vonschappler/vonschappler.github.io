            Hello everyone! <br>
            Two months after my last update, I took the time to update this site again and, because of that, here
            comes a note with everything I consider important to be detailed here. Some of you will not notice these changes in
            beginning, but after the details provided here, they will become clearer! <br>
            These are some "improvement / quality changes" in the layout of this site, as well as changes to reflect the guidelines
            security measures needed on parts of my website content.

        <h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">A quick Thank You</h1><br>
        <h4>
            I would like to start this note with a quick <div class="ui teal big label">Thank You!</div> to the members of my
            community! The main reason I am doing this here it's because last month I met some new people and made new friends! Individuals
            that respect me for who I am, for what I am, no matter if I have any mental health condition or not.<br>
            Also, I have to say that my gaming library and options for stream a now bigger because of those people! They were kind
            enough to gift me games from my <a href="https://rebrand.ly/vonGamesWish" target="_blank">Steam wishlist</a>! So, thank again
            for all you guys have done - YOU GUYS ROCK!<br>
            Ah, needless to say, I am close to achieving some Twitch goals thanks to this community support!

        <h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">Changes on the Schedule</h1><br>
        <h4>
            After considering all everything mentioned on the last informative note, I decided to make a new Schedule for my streams. Those changes will start
            taking place on July 5th, 2020 and there is still the possibilite of some future changes to it.<br>
            That said, keep note that my streams will follow the premise below:

                The table above is a simple version of the full schedule provided on the <code>Schedule</code> hyperlink on the
                navigation menu. That schedule is synced with Google Calendar!

        <div class="ui divider"></div>
        <h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">SSL and my Website changes</h1><br>
        <h4>
            Since I brought up this website, it's being hosted in a free hosting service and using a free domain. This is not a
            definitive step and won't be, since plans to buy and order pay hosting services are being planned.<br>
            Well, using a free hosting service with a free domain, have its advantages and its disadvantages. Not being possible to
            register an SSL certificate to it is one of these disadvantages and because of that I was forced to change a few things
            to reflect the <code>MDN policies</code> embedding contents.<br>
            As some of you may have noticed, it was possible to watch my streams (from my partners and mine) directly from this
            website. Well, according to the new policies, the only way to make that possible IS by having an SSL certificate registered
            to my domain and, as mentioned, those certificates are not provided (well, sold - expensively) to free domains.<br>
            In order to fix it, I had to make some changes to my site code. Since I was taking this time to make those changes, I
            also changed the layout of some other parts
            of the site, as listed below:
            <ul>
                <li>Moved all videos used on my website code to my YouTube channel</li>
                This change may cause some of the videos to present muted parts of it, due to the
                <a href="http://rebrand.ly/vonDMCAEn" target="_blank">DMCA policies</a> which are applied on YouTube (and Twitch - the
                reason why the document from the link is related to Twitch and my
                streams).<br><br>
                <li>Changed all the code where those embed videos were present to make the calls from my YouTube channel</li><br>
                <li>Removed all embeds that were pointing to Twitch, including the option to watch streams directly from my website
                </li>
                This means that the new <code>Partners</code> page layout has now only the option to follow their websites and that
                on my landing page there is no way to watch my streams. Only a <code>"Visit Twitch"</code> button is present now on
                those pages, allowing you to visit the page and follow them if you want.<br><br>
                <li>Added a Schedule link to the navigation bar</li>
                Having my schedule where it was placed on the website, made the access to it "hidden" to those who didn't have interest
                in navigating the whole site to look for my stream schedule.<br><br>
                <li>Moved the game reviews from <code>News</code> page to the <code>Gaming</code> page</li>
                New reviews are going to be posted there as well when they are ready to be posted.
            </ul>
            I honestly consider those changes a great step for both the structure of the website and to do my best to follow the SSL
            policies required for a website to be online.
