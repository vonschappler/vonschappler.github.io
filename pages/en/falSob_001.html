			The original note was posted on January 19, 2018, when the local media was making a totally irrational and unreal discussion about this subject, putting a character from a soap opera as "a game addict." It was then that I decided to post the following note on my personal Facebook profile:<br>

				So ... Here comes another serious talk. Some time ago I wanted to talk about it, but now with the big "boom" on the subject, media talking about it and everything, I think it's time to express what I really think about it.<br><br>
				I'm going to write a little of my story here and then make my own considerations. But to start, yes, I do believe in addiction for anything. A guy can be a coffee addict. Another, in gambling. There are those who are addicted to work and so on. I believe that I have already been (or still am) "addicted to games" - considering here the existence of this addiction.<br>
				<br>
				But here comes my story (or part of it, since I will not tell it completely). Few people really know me and know my real problems. Many of them refer to socialization, whether for always encountering people who "have nothing in common with me" or for not being able to fit in with what people consider to be "sociable." I'm not a person who likes to leave my house. In fact, I DEFINITELY CAN NOT LEAVE HOME (especially when the reason for the exit is a bit futile), but I leave when it is really necessary. I am also not a person of many friends and the few that I still preserve, curiously I found "in my addiction for games".<br>
				<br>
				Actually, because of my problems - yes I know that many of them "have a cure or treatment" - I do not see myself able to do many things. Let's then evaluate one of these things and see if the problem really is "lack of treatment." I, for example, pay my bills using virtual payment services, aka internet banking. I have followed this practice after being robbed on a "beautiful day" when I was away from home. Of course, after being robbed while going out to pay the bills, do you really think I would get on the street and risk being robbed again?<br><br>
				Instead of answering my question, the urge to judge others makes you think, "A normal person would." Come on, define what a normal person is. Truth is, for you what is normal, I call stupid. Self-preservation by not leaving home avoiding the risk of being robbed again is much smarter than "being normal" in that case. So I ask, "How do I treat my 'self-preservation' so that I can do what a 'normal person does' (and have the "wonderful chance" of being a victim of robbery again)?"<br>
				<br>
				Then your enormous desire to "be the owner of reason" makes you judge me again and think, "Oh, you do not go out because you were traumatized and traumas can be treated." (I would not expect an answer anyways, just judgments coming from someone who does not know how to look at anything but yourself). Dear reader... Fuck it if I do not leave because I'm traumatized. Nowadays, violence is so great and the value of human life is so small that we are risking our lives if someone robs us when we have nothing robbed - we could get killed. Would it be best to look for treatment or to "stay home", sick but alive?<br>
				<br>
				Then I see you judging (again), dodging a logical answer to my questioning and thinking: "You are too pessimist... What an exaggeration ..." Go, read a newspaper and see all the banal reasons why people are being murdered out there and tell me if I'm really being pessimistic or exaggerated, okay? Ah! After reading the newspaper, be sure to come back here to finish reading this text.<br>
				<br>
				Despite my young age, I saw so many things happening, I was in the middle of so much trouble, I went through so many problems that "my traumas" are currently what keeps me alive - the fear of seeing all this happening again just because I went out for something.<br>
				<br>
				Ok, it's a fact that because of this "fear" of leaving home, among other "fears" that go along with this, I do not have a formal job. I live with tips as I have a lot of difficulties finding clients for my specific type of work. But, on the other hand, I'm not putting my little body on display for the "vultures come and skin me alive" because of $2.50 (local currency) that I would have in my pocket to pay for a bus ticket simply go to work if I had a formal work. This is one of several factors to consider the reasons why I do not like to leave home. Okay, and what does this have to do with the subject of "game addiction"?<br>
				<br>
				Well, since I have a formal and almost never leave home, what do I do in my free time? If you have already came with your judgments (and assuming the title of this text) thinking: "I know, it's another game addicted and that's why you don't leave your house - to stay playing games", in a way, congratulations! You're right!<br>
				<br>
				But before you judge me completely, you know that I see videogame as my main way of keeping in touch with the world, as well as a great learning and development tool? Also, I have to say that games will not heal my traumas but they do not make them worse - which is more important for me. It may seem strange, but it was in a videogame that I witnessed the cleverest discussion about politics. It was not on the street, much less reading a newspaper whose political news is manipulated by the government. Yes, it was playing <u>Star Trek Online</u>, if you are curious to know where that I witnessed this conversation to which I just referred to.<br>
				<br>
				Also, take note that thanks to a videogame (through their fantasies) that some people arouse their interest in mythology (especially the Greek) - yes I am talking about <u>God of War</u>, not forgetting to mention some influence that <u>Age of Mythology</u> did years before, since these are two games that I can quote when discussing this topic.<br>
				<br>
				Man, what about Assassin's Creed? It has a very large historical and scientific content, even if fantasized in my view ... Well, games without a little fantasy, would not be games anyways... Fantasy is necessary in this case. But returning to the focus of this text, I emphasize that among one of the many discussions addressed in <u>Assassin's Creed</u>, what strikes me most is that the game talks about genetic memory! People, genetic memory is a fact ... The evolution of species somehow applies this concept naturally, because the strongest genetics prevails and any evolutionary change relevant to the environment is passed from generation to generation - this is (a simple way of defining) genetic memory... (I ask my companions who understand much more about Assassin's Creed than I to correct me if I am wrong about this point.)<br>
				<br>
				I have to say that, in fact, it was because of a videogame that I improved a lot of what I know about other languages like English, Spanish and developed a great interest for the German language. I point out here that videogames were the place where I met people from the Netherlands, Peru, Chile, Spain, Portugal, Poland, Russia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, England, United States - people with whom I (mostly) until today, am learning a little bit about their local culture - and I'm sure I would never have known them if I haven't spend a few hours of my day playing games...<br>
				<br>
				What I'm trying to say here is that regardless of whether people (including my own family), by considering it an addiction or not, videogames have provided good things in my life and still continue to provide. I would even say much better things than life outside of them.<br>
				<br>
				Have you ever stopped to think that a simple videogame puts you to evaluate math concepts and populational geography? Yes! There are games that help you understand how a city grows, how to manage finances (personal and public), as long as the player knows how to abstract this information from the game. I, particularly, think that if many of the politicians we had out there had the opportunity to play something like <u>Cities Skylines</u> or <u>SimCity</u>, public money would be much better managed and used correctly for social welfare.<br>
				<br>
				Others, still talking about mathematical knowledge bring in a "playful" way, strangely as it may seem, throughout the process of "crafting" and selling items, force you to think - even without you realizing it - in economics concepts, since you need to account for "what to spend" and "how much you will spend" in addition to needing to understand about the "internal economy of the game" to check if crafts has a real commercial value, not to take losses!<br>
				<br>
				And what about <u>EVE Online</u>, where the concept of "clan"/guild, used in many other multiplayer games, is put here as a COMPANY, encouraging players to think like ENTREPRENEURS of their "clan" . Instead of "clanmates", there are employers, rather than a "clan lead" there is a "CEO". Administer a space mining company, look how AWESOME it is! The time has come for you, as an administration graduate, to put theory in practics inside a simple "ship" game, instead of judging me!<br>
				<br>
				Of course, I can not forget to mention Project Discoveries within EVE. When I came into contact with the game for the first time, Project Discovery had its results evaluated by biologists. That's right, scientists were interested in results provided by players about analyzing cell tissue samples as a form of aid in their research. Currently, "Project Discovery" has its results evaluated by astronomers and its focus is on discovering information about possible exoplanets, based on REAL DATA of luminosity measurement emitted by celestial bodies. See yourself, who consider (us) gamers "a bunch of addicts," the testimony of a renowned astronomer, Prof. Michel Mayor, talking about his "discovery" and partnering with players on EVE Online. (Why a renowned astronomer would be interested in "addicts" and an "electronic game"?)<br>

				</div><br>
				There are strategy games (RTS) which force you to think and act fast to solve an urgent problem that appeared due to the failed strategy that you set up. Look with other eyes and realize the importance of the "training" for life that a game like this provides because it is necessary to think under pressure to solve a problem that (at least in a game) you created yourself. How many times in life outside games did not we have to act on pressure, and sometimes we fail because of lack of "training"?<br>
				<br>
				There are puzzle games that set you to abstract how to solve a simple problem by moving blocks from side to side inside a room until you find a logical sequence/coherence to open a simple door and escape from that room.<br>
				<br>
				For those who still doubt the "potential of a game", I remark here that even fighting games bring concepts that I consider relevant to an individual's daily life. Newer fighting games (I mention two that I know, but I believe in the existence of similar ones: <u>Mortal Kombat X</u> - this one has biological models so realistic in their graphics that even biology it teaches to an individual, those models appear during the cutscenes of the famous "X-Ray" and "fatalities" attacks - and <u>Killer Instinct</u>) brings a huge table with all the information about the attacks - things like recovery time, frames of attack, defense frames are listed on those tables, which are concepts to be considered during a gameplay...<br>
				<br>
				If the player knows how to abstract all this information into his daily life and can understand that: a) every action has a reaction; b) that reaction has a response time; c) that his actions need to be evaluated to be executed at the correct time; or d) that all actions leave an opening time and if that opening is used in the wrong way, it can be "punished" - in the case of the game would be the attack frames, defense recovery data, etc. - imagine the kind of "superhuman" this player will be when s/he is out of the game!<br>
				<br>
				So talking about "game addiction" is TOO heavy. "There is not really a REAL game addiction, in general, among (us) gamers." I would say that a person is born prone to addiction (anyway, including videogame addiction) when that person simply can not see how much can be learned from games (like the ones I mentioned above) or when that person can not extract and use the immense amount of information s/he learned from games, simply to play in an unmanageable/irrational way.<br>
				<br>
				In fact, if it is to talk about addiction, we also should start talking about addiction to football/soccer, for the carnival, addiction to meddling in other people's lives, shouldn't we? Remember that all these addictions are much worse than videogame addiction, after all, there is NOTHING to be absolved of these addictions, as opposed to the vastness of knowledge that can be earned by playing videogames (if the player has the will to learn, of course).<br>
				<br>
				To point out once more what I'm talking about (learning from gaming), I'll give MY example, quickly... As I said at the beginning I was (or still am) a "videogame addict", but thanks to games, I'm here at the moment looking multiple sheets with frame counting annotations, calculations with time units conversion, I have studied and researched on creating and editing videos. I'm also looking at another sheet full of tag data made in videos that I've edited and need to edit, aside from mentioning studies color theory (things like RGB and CMYK) to work with color code annotations. Thanks to the games, I have improved my knowledge in CSS, HTML, image editing, logo creation - for the simple desire to make a channel for producing content for YouTube/Twitch - as a way to occupy my free time while I am not working, and who knows until having a source of income, since "being a streamer" is currently a (informal) profession. Incidentally, all of this I mentioned earlier are things that I have learned over time and that "simply" improve my work techniques for my beaks... Look at what I learned in practice!<br>

				</div><br>
				Ah, I cannot help but mentioning that my musical taste has been intensely improved after listening to soundtracks of some games... Without much prolongation here, just look at the masterpieces that make up the soundtrack of <u>NieR: Automata</u>, for example (it's just an example of the several I can describe).<br>
				<br>
				So before you judge, by saying that videogames are addictive, remember that it's not games. Think that a "videogame addict" today, could be the "drugs addict" who robs you only to spend your salary in order to maintain that drugs addiction.<br>
				<br>
				That was my outburst and my opinion on the subject. In short, it is not a game that causes dependence. People are born with this tendency to addiction and can be addicted to anything else... "They" only choose videogames (if we consider playing videogame as an addiction)... Oh, remember that if you see someone who plays videogame showing a behavior marked by frequent acts of fury, constant annoyances, toxicity to others, just remember that this type of behavior would be the same presented in front of ANY OTHER ACTIVITY THAT CAUSES FRUSTRATION - but these behaviors are regarded as a behavior of an addicted, since anyone addicted to anything would behave in the same way in periods of abstinence.<br>
				<br>
				That said, it's OBVIOUS I will not say that I never "raged" during a game session. It is natural for human beings to have their moments of anger, whether with a game or with anything else (as I have noted above). I'm not going to say that I've never bothered with a game, it's natural, too. But, believe it or not, I have suffered much more severe annoyances with much smaller things than "not being able to complete a certain stage inside a videogame".<br>
				<br>
				Notice that games even help in the development of emotional intelligence (and I just came to remember that now)! Talking about this subject, there is a very interesting video that I have posted other times in my timeline and I will post it again: it's about "videogames and aggressivity" - subject that refers somehow to what I said here about "videogame and addiction", for giving an opening to a similar discussion. It is not because someone plays videogames that the person is aggressive, either addicted (even if it plays for extended periods).<br>
				<br>
				<div class="ui equal width stackable internally celled grid">
					<div class="center aligned row">
						<div class="column middle aligned">
						  <h2>... aggression levels were up and empathy levels were lower. But here's the thing! Those same results can be found after any competitive or frustrating task, whether that be not being able to solve a math problem...</h2>

					</div>
				</div><br>
				So, why all this no sense "discussion" about "game addiction" in the media with so many other WORSE addictions out there?<i class="right floated quote right icon right aligned" style="margin-left: 0.5em"></i><br>
				<br>
				Well, that's it! I hope you guys enjoyed this essay with my opinion about this subject.
