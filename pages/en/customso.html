			Streamers have plenty of ways to support or show appreciation to other streamers. Raids, Hosts,
			Ads (also called ShoutOuts) are some of those ways. This script basically helps streamers in the
			Ad "portion" of this support to others.<br>
			Also, it's not always that a streamer will have modeators at hand to help him/her in this advertising
			to fellow streamers, and thinking on this specific situation, I come here to offer you a brand new
			script that will help with that! The list below resumes what <code>Custom ShoutOut</code> can do for
			you (as streamer):
			<ul>
				<li>Create a file with "custom messages" per streamer you want to call out on your stream</li>
				<li>Allow Auto-ShoutOuts for raiders and saved streamers when they join your channel or send
					their first message during a stream session (saved streamers only)
				</li>
				<li>Offer total control of the saved streamers file, based on commands and UI interface buttons</li>
				<li>Deep log system to allow control of everything done by the script during a stream session</li>
			</ul>
			Let's now go a bit deeper into the specifications of each field of the script!
			<div class="ui inverted segment">
				<h4 class="ui horizontal inverted divider">IMPORTANT:</h4>
				Any changes made to ANY fields in this script will just take effect after the button <code>"Save
				Settings"</code> (at the end of the script UI) is pressed and the script is reloaded. It's also
				necessary to say that most of the replies from the script are sent to the user's whisper, meaning
				that for the user to make sure the changes made were successful or not, they will need to have
				your bot added as a friend in order to get all the whispers from it, in case the user has whispering
				feature blocked on Twitch.

			This group is responsible for the basic settings of the script. It's where you control the basic behavior of the bot.<br><br>
			<code>a.1) Auto ShoutOut saved casters?</code><br>
			This feature will enable or disable the option for the bot to Auto-ShoutOut casters/streamers saved on your
			casters' file, which creation will be detailed later.<br><br>
			<code>a.2) ShoutOut when caster joins channel?</code><br>
			If enabled, this feature will send a custom ShoutOut (if defined) whenever a saved caster joins your channel. If
			disabled, it's necessary for the saved caster to send anything on your chat in order for the bot to ShoutOut the
			saved caster. Saved casters will be ShoutOut only once per session with this feature. For extra ShoutOuts, it's
			necessary to do it via command.<br><br>
			<code>a.3) Auto ShoutOut raiders?</code><br>
			This feature will Auto-ShoutOut raiders on your channel based on the settings defined in the next group.

			As already stated, this group controls how the bot will behave if <code>a.3</code> function is enabled. It's even
			possible to send a test raid to the script (thanks to the script made by
			"<a href="https://twitter.com/kruiser8" target="_blank">Kruiser8</a>'s <code>Raid Notify</code> script". A few
			changes where made to his code in order to make this raid testing a bit more realistic.<br><br>
			<code>b.1) Message to use for ShoutOut raiders:</code><br>
			This is where you can set a custom message to be sent as an Auto-ShoutOut whenever you are raided by someone. Note
			that for this to work correctly, a few parameters MUST be added to your custom message:
			<ul>
				<li><code>{raider}</code>: this will be replaced automatically by the raider's name</li>
				<li><code>{count}</code>: this will be replaced automatically by the number of viewers raiding you</li>
				<li><code>{url}</code>: this will be replaced automatically by the raider's channel URL on Twitch</li>
				<li><code>{game}</code>: this will be replaced automatically by the last game played by the raider</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="ui raised segment">
				Example of working message:<br>
				<code>
					{raider} was playing {game} and just brought {count} viewers to our channel! Let's support them visiting {url} !
				</code>
			</div>
			<div class="ui inverted segment">
				<div class="ui inverted horizontal divider">IMPORTANT:</div>
				The script will check for the presence of the parameters listed above when trying to save the custom message for
				ShoutOuts to raiders. So for the message to be accepted by the script, remember to always give a blank space
				after each one of the parameters used and make sure to add ALL the parameters on your message!
			</div>
			<code>b.2) Minimum raiders to Auto ShoutOut:</code><br>
			This specifies the number of viewers the raider needs to bring to your channel in order to be Auto-ShoutOut.<br><br>
			<code>b.3) Save raiders to caster file?</code><br>
			If enabled, this feature will add an entry to the saved casters' file for use later by the script.<br><br>
			<code>b.4) Test Raider AutoSO settings:</code><br>
			Clicking this button, the scrip will send a "fake" raid to test the settings defined above. If <code>a.3</code> is enabled,
			the script will display on your Twitch chat the custom message defined on <code>b.1</code> and if <code>b.3</code> is
			enabled, it will save (or update) an entry with the raid details to your casters' file.
			<div class="ui inverted segment">
				As already mentioned, this part of the script was made with the help of already existing script ("Raid Notify") made by

			This group here is to manage how the bot will control settings for both "manual" (extra) ShoutOuts, Auto-ShoutOuts and even
			give the possibility to manualy ShoutOut casters which are not saved on your casters' file.<br><br>
			<code>c.1) Command for manual ShoutOut:</code><br>
			This field is used to set the command used for manual ShoutOuts in case <code>a.1</code> is disabled or if you see fit making
			extras ShoutOuts. This command will ShoutOut saved casters on your casters' file.
			<div class="ui raised compact segment">
			USAGE:<br>
			<code>!caster &lt;casterName&gt;</code> or <code>!caster &lt;@casterName&gt;</code><br>
			ANSWER:<br>
			The answer depends on the settings saved for this script. In fact, the bot will look for the entry of <code>casterName</code> on
			your casters' file and will post a message with an ad to <code>casterName</code>'s Twitch Channel.
			</div>
			<code>c.2) Permission to use the command:</code><br>
			This is self explanative. Just users with the required permission will be able to use the command set on <code>c.1</code>. By default,
			<code>Moderators</code> are the basic permit setting for using this command but it's up to the user to define who they want to be able
			to ShoutOut casters on their channel.<br><br>
			<code>c.3) Default message for ShoutOuts:</code><br>
			Similar to what was detailed on <code>b.1</code>, this field is used to set an ad message to be posted on chat. This one is called
			as "Default message" for a reason to be detailed later on this guide. For this message to be accepted by the script, it NEEDS to have the
			following specified parameters:
			<ul>
				<li><code>{caster}</code>: this will be replaced automatically by the caster's name (required parameter)</li>
				<li><code>{url}</code>: this will be replaced automatically by the caster's Twitch Channel link (required parameter)</li>
				<li><code>{game}</code>: this will be replaced automatically by the caster last played game (optional parameter)</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="ui raised segment">
				Example of working message:<br>
				<code>Let's support my friend {caster} visiting their {url} ! There were playing {game} on their last stream!</code>
			</div>

				ShoutOuts to casters. So for the message to be accepted by the script, remember to always give a blank space
				after each one of the parameters used and make sure to add ALL REQUIRED parameters on your message!
			</div>
			<code>c.4) Global cooldown (in seconds):</code><br>
			Specifies a small cooldown to avoid spam of the command in case it's used by two or more permitted users in a short
			difference time smaller than the value defined. The default setting value is 5 seconds and it can go up to 60 seconds
			(1 minute).<br><br>
			<code>c.5) Allow manual shout to unsaved casters?</code><br>
			Enabling this feature will grant permission to the script to ShoutOut casters which are not saved on your casters' file by using the command defined
			in <code>c.1</code>.

			This section here is the core of this script. First of all, here is where you set all the commands necessary to manage what's going to be added
			to your casters' file that is going to be used by the script.<br><br>
			<code>d.1) Command to add a new caster to AutoShoutOut:</code><br>
			This is the command you and your editors (yes, it's set by default for security reasons to just editor have access to use it) will add a new
			caster tor your casters' file. It's important to mention that all casters added to your casters' file will ALWAYS be "ShoutOut" by the script
			(following the specified settings defined in the fields already detailed), unless specified differently with the <code>ALLOW</code> definition
			(this setting will be explained later in this guide).
			<div class="ui compact raised segment">
				USAGE:<br>
				<code>!addcaster &lt;casterName&gt;</code> or <code>!addcaster &lt;casterName&gt; &lt;customMessage&gt;</code><br>
				ANSWER:<br>
				The answer will depend on the way of the usage of the command. Logging for this command is tracked by the script and the fail or success
				answer will be sent to the user's whisper.
			</div>
			<div class="ui inverted segment">
				<div class="ui inverted horizontal divider">IMPORTANT:</div>
				<ul>
					<li>If nothing is written after &lt;casterName&gt;, the script will add an entry to &lt;casterName&gt; to send ShoutOuts using the 
						<code>Default Message</code> set on <code>c.3</code></li>
					<li>EVERYTHING that comes after the &lt;casterName&gt; will be interpreted by the script was your custom message and the script will
						try to set it as the custom message. With this in mind, remember: THIS CUSTOM MESSAGE NEEDS to follow the specified rules - and
						example - already detailed on how to set a message on <code>c.3</code></li>
				</ul>
			</div>	
			<code>d.2) Command to edit information from a caster to AutoShoutOut:</code><br>
			With this command, you and your editors can change the informations saved inside your casters' file. Those are the details that can be edited:
			<ul>
				<li><code>name</code>: changes the name (aka Twitch handle/username) of a saved caster on your casters' file of a saved caster</li>
				<li><code>msg</code>: changes the message set for a caster saved on your casters' file</li>
				<li><code>allow</code>: changes the behavior of the script to allow the caster to be or not to be shout by this script</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="ui raised segment">
				USAGE:<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Changing a caster name:</li>
					<code>!setcaster &lt;casterName&gt; name &lt;newCasterName&gt;</code><br><br>
					<li>Changing a caster message from the default message to a custom message:</li>
					<code>!setcaster &lt;casterName&gt; msg &lt;customMessage&gt;</code><br>
					(&lt;customMessage&gt; MUST follow the rules specified in <code>c.3</code>)<br><br>
					<li>Changing a caster message from a custom to "Default Message" (set in <code>c.3</code>):</li>
					<code>!setcaster &lt;casterName&gt; msg Default</code><br>
					(Default MUST BE WRITTEN with capital "D")<br><br>
					<li>Changing the bot behavior to ShoutOuts:</li>
					<code>!setcaster &lt;casterName&gt; allow yes</code> (bot will shout out &lt;casterName&gt; using the defined settings)<br>
					<code>!setcaster &lt;casterName&gt; allow no</code> (bot will not shout out &lt;casterName&gt;)<br>
				</ul>
				ANSWER:<br>
				The answer provided to this command will depend on what is being requested to be changed and on if the change was
				made successfully or not. The answer for this request will ALWAYS be sent to the user's whisper.
			</div>
			<code>d.3) Command to delete a caster from AutoShoutOut:</code><br>
			This command is used by you and your editors to delete information for a single caster (by his/her name) from your casters' file.
			<div class="ui raised segment">
				USAGE:<br>
				<code>!delcaster &lt;casterName&gt;</code><br>
				ANSWER:<br>
				The script will look out for &lt;casterName&gt; entry on your casters' file and delete it from the file. If &lt;casterName&gt;
				is not found, no action is taken. The answer sent to the user's whisper depends on the success or fail of removal of
				&lt;casterName&gt; from casters' file.
			</div>
			<code>d.4) Command to check info about a saved caster:</code><br>
			This command is the only one in this group used by moderators, editors and you to inspect a set of basic information about a single saved caster on your casters' file.
			<div class="ui raised segment">
				USAGE:<br>
				<li>Inspecting all basic saved information:</li>
				<code>!chkcaster &lt;casterName&gt; all</code><br><br>
				<li>Inspecting the message to be displayed in chat during ShoutOuts:</li>
				<code>!chkcaster &lt;casterName&gt; msg</code><br><br>
				<li>Inspecting the script behavior to ShoutOuts:</li>
				<code>!chkcaster &lt;casterName&gt; allow</code><br><br>
				ANSWER:<br>
				The answer will depend on what is being inspected as it will depend if the request returned a successful result or not related to
				&lt;casterName&gt;.
			</div>
			<code>d.5) List all saved Casters</code><br>
			Clicking this button will print in ChatBot Log section a list with all the contents of your saved casters' file.<br><br>
			<code>d.6) I am sure I want to reset my casters' file.</code><br>
			Checking this is MANDATORY ONLY IF you want to reset your casters' file to the initial status, with no casters saved in there.<br><br>
			<code>d.7) I want to create a backup of current casters' file. (Recomended)</code><br>
			Enabling this is OPTIONAL. If this option is enabled, the script will copy all the information of the last saved casters' file into a file with
			the extension <code>*.bk</code> ("bk" stands here for backup), before erasing all the data from the main casters' file.
			<div class="ui inverted segment">
				NOTE: If there is already a *.bk file on the script directory, checking this option will overwrite the last saved (and existent) backup of
				casters' file, replacing all data in there.
			</div>
			<code>d.8) Reset casters' file</code><br>
			This is self-explanatory and will work properly ONLY if <code>d.6</code> is enabled.<br><br>
			<code>d.9) Revert casters' file</code><br>
			This will load your casters' file back to a previous state based on the last saved backup.

			This is another self-explanatory group. These settings are here to manage the script usage LogFiles of when/how it was used during a stream
			session. For users who like to have more control over what's happening or want to report any bug on the script, these LogFile settings are here
			for that purpose.<br><br>
			<code>e.1) Display Script log in the ChatBot?</code><br>
			By default, this feature is disabled, and as it says it will display the usage log "live" within the ChatBot log section ("Scripts &gt; Logs").<br><br>
			<code>e.2) AutoSave ScriptLog file?</code><br>
			By default, this feature is enabled. This will ensure that a log file is saved under the <code>Log</code> directory created by the script when:
			<ul>
				<li>the bot is closed</li>
				<li>the script is reloaded within the bot</li> or
				<li>the script is disabled within the bot</li>

			<div class="ui inverted segment">
				NOTE: Clicking this button will also prevent from saving another file or rewriting the actual LogFile contents with another Log information.
