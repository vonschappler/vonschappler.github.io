		<h4>
			Okay, I'll be clear here. As hard as it is to admit to myself that 2018 was not as good as I expected, I need to present this sincere and realistic note to all of you members of my community.<br>
			<br>
			After facing so many problems in my life, I decided to look for an alternative job. Just a few know, but I have several mental health problems, which at the moment prevent me from having a "formal" job. That's when I saw how the e-sports were on the rise. I always had the dream of participating as a member of an e-sports team. I tried playing the traditional MOBA games, but the excess of toxicity brought an immense frustration that made me give up the competitive area of the games.<br>
			<br>
			I then thought about entering in the gaming world, by making my own games and selling them. Well, I also got frustrated, because developing the game the way I wanted/planned that time required (and still requires) a lot. The first of these things I would need was vast knowledge in areas which I have no qualms about and because of my "mental deficiency" - yes I suffer from a mild mental deficiency, although it doesn't seem and my family don't accept this fact or unknowing it - I am unable to progress in certain things, especially after I have lost all interest in these things.<br>
			<br>
			That's then when I decided to create my Twitch account, five years ago. But what does all this have to do with "2018, the year of poorly executed planning"? Well, after I created my Twitch account I started following game launches more often, watching streams of successful people/groups/companies in this area, and I thought this would be the ideal branch for a person with my "specific condition." In 2017, I started the preparations for doing this, since I have a (considerably) library and I have in my hands a PC, which although "old" - it's a seven years old rig, it still "rocks" when it comes to playing games.<br>
			<br>
			I planned a lot, studied a lot of things in that area. I did a lot of testing, until the day came when I felt ready to put into action everything I had planned. It is a fact that TODAY, the day I am writing this note, this is what I have:
			<ul>
				<li>A library with more than 170 games (considering only the most modern and digital games) - this library can be seen on the "Gaming" page of this site</li>
				<li>A <a href="http://bit.ly/vonSchapplerYouTube" target="_blank">YouTube</a> channel with less than 30 subscribers, and two of those subscribers are "alt accounts" I own and use for moderation tests purpose</li>
				<li>A <a href="http://bit.ly/vonSchapplerTwitch" target="_blank">Twitch</a>, channel with 87 followers, from which, I have to admit, NONE is active. That's right, all my stream sessions are done for me and myself alone, considering the fact those followers RARELY are in there to show their appreciation to the ENORMOUS work I had all this time to give them contents with the best quality possible</li>
				<li>A <a href="http://bit.ly/vonSchapplerDiscord" target="_blank">Discord</a> server - literaly DEAD - since none of my "followers" even appear there and the few people that are on this server are always OFFLINE or when they are online, they do not type a single word</li>
				<li>Surveys (both in <a href="http://bit.ly/vonSchapplerSurveyEN" target="_blank">Enligsh</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/vonSchapplerSurveyPT" target="_blank">Portuguese</a>) for evaluation of them stream quality, making it able for me to listen to the opinion/suggestion of the viwers, whether they were NEVER answered or read by anyone who passed through my stream</li>
				<li>A computer that is dying and needing updates URGENTLY or soon I will not be able to make streams, since in the last attempts to make streams I was surprised with frequent freezes in the stream and had so many "dropped frames"</li>
				<li>A fanpage on <a href="http://bit.ly/vonSchapplerPageFacebook" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, which, just like my discord server, is also dead</li>
				<li>A customized bot to serve my audience, since it is programmed to respond in two different languages when a <a href="http://bit.ly/vonSchapplerCommands" target="_blank">custom command</a> is used on chat, that NOBODY has ever made use of its features</li>
				<li>This website that, despite being advertised all the time by my bot during live streams, NEVER received a visit aside mine to make updates/revisions of text</li>
			</ul>
			You know, I work alone, without anyone's help. I have to write, update the site, moderate my chat, adjust everything to the streams, make posts on the social media about when I am going live, still find time to help others in an altruistic way and the truth behind it all is that I am seeing me facing a major fail. So much work not to receive any support, either from "friends", followers and family. I have strived to create a community that welcomes all, regardless of gender, color or race, sexual choice, mental illness. I'm feeling extremely frustrated with all this. Frustrated by living inside (one more) lie I created for myself, thinking that things would be different. That's not what happened.<br>
			<br>
			In 2018, especially after I got the Affiliate status, I thought things would be different, but they turned out to be even worse. A small personal victory was followed by several defeats that threw me down, undermining every stimulus I have to continue. I planned events, changed my stream calendar, trying to attract people to be part of that community I want to create, making room for everyone, but nothing I planned worked as intended.<br>
			<br>
			I'm not streaming for fame, like most... I have to admit, I'm actually doing this to be able to pay my bills since I am unable to have a "formal" job and then streaming would be my primary source of money income. I'm actually just wasting money, creating expenses that I'm not being able to afford to keep my PC turned on all day long doing off stream jobs, looking partnerships, helping other streamers, or making changes to my own channel. I am also not having the success of other people who follow my steps/advises. It's amazing to see what I do for me does not work for me, but it works with others when they repeat what I do.<br>
			<br>
			Well, those who follow me know that I put in the Updates panel that I created on my Twitch channel, constant news regarding the stream nights. They also know of the accident that happened to my father on 12/24/2018 and that after this accident, things got EVEN worse. My life turned upside down, making it even more unfeasible to stream as I had planned for December and January. Probably now in February, this scene will repeat itself and this will be another month of frustration and poorly executed planning or maybe even a month with non executed plans.

		<h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">So, what's going to happen in 2019?</h1><br>
		<h4>
			Although I have a schedule for my streams, I have to admit, again, that it will not be easy to keep this schedule. The lack of support is what is currently becoming the biggest obstacle I am facing. Of all the plans I have for this year, the only one I decided to make public is my participation in the Extra Life fundraising campaign. The other plans will be executed WHEN and IF they are possible to be executed. In face of all the difficulties and frustrations I mentioned earlier, the only thing I can do is to count on your understanding and ask for more effective and incisive support if you want to help this one who is writing this text now, allowing me to grow and make progress as a streamer, to the point that I can at least afford to pay for the expenses created for those streaming time.<br>
			<br>
			It's really embarrassing for me to get to this point. But unfortunately, it is necessary, because I am no longer able to move on and if you are reading this, do not make your part to give your support for me, it is IMPOSSIBLE to continue. I do not want to appear ungrateful here with some people who offer sporadic help, but I am asking this community to transform itself into real a community, by stop being just numbers and start becoming an active group and enjoying all that I have developed and created for you guys. Yes, I know I am relying on a financial return, but as long as it does not come, the simple fact of having an active and participative community is enough to allow me to continue and then set plans in action for you and all those who is going to join us from now on.<br>
			<br>
			Yes, it is difficult to proceed alone, streaming only to a bot, without someone there to talk, to give suggestions, to help and talk discreetly about the quality of the stream, to help remembering something when it is necessary... Precisely for this reason, I have also opened forms looking for people who can assist me in this, as moderators of my channel - these forms are available in <a href="http://bit.ly/ModerationFormEN" target="_blank">Enlish</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/ModerationFormPT" target="_blank">Portuguese</a>, thus giving all of you another opportunity to become more active in this community.<br>
			<br>
			The streams will continue, however ONLY when I feel able to do them, after all how will I bring quality content if I'm not feeling good about myself due all this frustration I've been through lately? In the meantime I'm looking for games that I judge interesting to bring to the channel, doing the overlays for some other streamers, when they come to me for that kind of help, moderating chat to some streamers that are on my list of partners/friends, studying ways to enhance the content that I bring to you among other things. But remember, a streamer without a community is like a body without a soul. If this reflection that I am doing here really makes you understand how important you, as an ACTIVE community, are to me as a streamer, do not forget to give me your support, not just by <a href = "mailto: vonschappler.gaming@gmail.com?subject=My word of support ">e-mail</a> but also being active during the streams when they happen!
