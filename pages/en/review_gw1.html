				What to say about the Guild Wars series? Well, to begin with, I need to say that the first game from this series I have played was Guild Wars 2, at its early begining, back in 2012. This
				game is uses a buy-to-play model, meaning there are no monthly fees to keep playing it! That said, well, a few years later, I finally was able to buy the first game of this series which
				is formed not only by two games (and its expansions), but also has three novels:
				<b><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Guild-Wars-2-Ghosts-Ascalon/dp/1416589473/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1279127385&sr=8-1" target="_blank">Ghosts of Ascalon</a></b> (published on Jul/27/2010),
				<b><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Guild-Wars-J-Robert-King/dp/1416589600/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1304466303&sr=1-1" target="_blank">Edge of Destiny</a></b> (published on Dec/28/2010),
				and <b><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Guild-Wars-Sorrows-Ree-Soesbee/dp/1416589627" target="_blank">Sea of Sorrows</a></b> (published on Jun/25/2013) - which I still plan to buy and read!<br><br>
				There are lots of details to be pointed out as far as the overall look of the game. I want to begin by praising the immersive gameplay that this series (as a whole) offers,
				bringing an extended open world to be explored (to get an idea of the extent of this world, <a href="https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/List_of_maps" target="_blank">click here</a>),
				besides several campaigns that compose this series.<br><br>
				Analyzing all the publications for this series, we have a total of 11 titles (last time I checked) from the launch of the first game (2005) until the most recent publication, an expansion
				pack for Guild Wars 2. However, here I will talk only about the first part of the series, which is formed by the game (and expansions) listed in Table 01.<br><br>
				Let's begin with the reaction I had in my first contact with this game. Despite being a game released in 2005, I only had access to it in November 2015 (as I mentioned before - my contact
				with it was a few years after I had already played Guild Wars 2).<br><br>
				At first, I was literally upset about the game: "What do you mean devs? Why cannot I jump in this game?". That was my thought every time I came across an obstacle that could easily be avoided
				with the "jumping" function of my character - after all, after two years playing Guild Wars 2 and making extreme use of "leaping" over obstacles, it was natural to think that every
				obstacle would be overcome with a jump.<br><br>
				What an illusion of mine! It took a while for me to get used to Guild Wars (and I still have some tight fights in there because of it). I even gave up playing Guild Wars several times.
				However, I still play it from time to time, hoping to unlock unique items for the second game of the series, as unlocking certain items which are linked to my account, gives me, the player,
				incentives to "never give up." - especially considering the fact I can say I am a "game completionist".<br><br>

				The fact is that by my nature as a player who does not like to remain stuck in any game, I left the game and tried to come back (many times) and... as you can imagine, I still haven't
				managed to finish Guild Wars. I can not forget to mention that my biggest obstacle was (and still is) to consider the gameplay very strict. Being used to dodging attacks, jumping on
				certain points and practically never finding any "invisible wall", are factors that make me play Guild Wars like I play Guild Wars 2. The truth is that I had (and still have) to put
				in my mind: "This game is the first in the series so I can not play the same way I play the second."<br><br>
				I guess that only when I put this in my mind will I finally be able to get used to this gameplay. This is being worked on because, whenever I can, I get one of my characters to
				try to move on in the story told in Guild Wars.<br><br>
				Ah! I can not forget to mention here that the story is formed by impressive and complex lore (which can be read in its instruction manuals - available for download in the
				<a href="https://www.guildwars.com/en/download" target="_blank">official site</a>) with a serie of calendars with historical events to help to situate the players at what time of
				the story they are "living".<br><br>
				Now to talk about the game itself: Guild Wars (also known as Guild Wars: Prophecies) places the player in the position of a hero who is guiding his people through the universe of Kryta
				in search of a new home because their old lair (Ascalon) was totally dominated by a race of creatures called Charr.<br><br>
				Walking through Ascalon, Shilverpeaks Mountains, Lions Arch among other areas (so far unknown to me, after all, as I said, I've never been able to finish the game), we find ourselves
				fighting Charrs, dwarves, gargoyles, minotaurs, centaurs, undead, and anything else that thing you can imagine.<br><br>
				As for the gameplay and evolution of the character, the well known "classic classes" are called here professions, and it is possible for the player to choose up to two professions
				(primary and secondary) that provides unique mechanics and abilities. The basic professions are presented in table 2.<br><br>

				In this game, you are able to switch your skillset when you are inside some cities, as long as your profession (or professions, if you have two professions)
				have that skill unlocked. Skills are unlocked by side quests, tokens you get from various activities like PvP and GvG, and/or learning a (new) profession. There are some
				universal skills that can be used by any profession. Equipment-wise, there is no restriction on which kind of weapon/armor your character can use and it's possible to create
				up to four loadouts that can be switched on-the-fly during gameplay, as long as you have the items used on those loadouts inside your character inventory.<br><br>
				As you progress with the history, it's possible to meet specific NPCs (aka heroes) which will follow you on your path along Kryta. Those heroes can be unlocked before meeting
				them if you want to buy those (I may be wrong about this, but there are also some unique heroes that are only unlocked only if you buy them).<br><br>
				Everything you achieve/collect in the game can be displayed in a place called "Hall of Monuments" - which when linked to a Guild Wars 2 account will reward you with cosmetics
				for your characters in Guild Wars 2, as you fill the display of this Hall with your achievements/collections. In total, there are 50 items to be unlocked and the game provides a
				<a href="https://hom.guildwars2.com/en/#page=welcome" target="_blank">great calculator</a> to help players on keep tracking on what they need to do in order to access all 50
				unlockable goodies for Guild Wars 2<br><br>
