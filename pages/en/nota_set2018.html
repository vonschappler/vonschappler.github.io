			I understand the need to post something like this, especially after so much time inactive, as well as presenting some justifications for some choices made for channel evolution. This note will be made in the form of a Q&A, to facilitate how I present my ideas and justifications.<br>
			That way I ask for the understanding of all of you and thank you for your patience in reading this document which is very important.

		<h4>
			Right. Let's start evaluating things as follows. Outside the "show business", I also have a private life, which in recent times has been very troubled. Some disappointments with people I trusted, with the work do outside the gamer world, among other things, constant problems with my equipment, problems with internet provider (incidentally, problems that have not been solved until now - 3 months later of several complaints and calls for technical assistance). These disappointments were directly influencing my physical and mental health, to the point that I really saw the need to pause.<br>
		</h4>
		<div class="ui divider"></div>
		<h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">What was I doing during this time?</h1><br>
		<h4>
			In this period of (forced) pause, although I was not directly producing content, I kept working on a few things to improve the quality of what I produce, bringing something more and more professional and referring to a specific brand. I want to remember that I was already planning to pause to do all of this, but this pause would be well planned, so I had something pre-produced to maintain the life of the channel. Unfortunately, the conditions that were imposed on me by adverse situations did not allow this.<br>
			Well, things happen as they have to be and even annoyed with all these problems, I dedicated my time to a total redesign of the channel and the social networks associated with it - this includes this website.

		<h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">What justifies these changes?<br>What will happen with series of gameplays<br>which have been started previously?</h1><br>
		<h4>
			Some of these changes comes with the intention of bringing more variety of content besides following the basic premise of my way of playing: "Play for fun"... When I had problems with equipment and lost several videos recorded, prepared to do editions and/or to ready to de puloaded, this incident really left me very disheartened to continue the series <b>The Division</b> and <b>Mass Effect</b>.<br>
			Something similar happened to me with the <b>Dragon Ages</b> series (which I was doing a series on live streams). Origin application for some reason that E.A. can not explain or solve, has been causing major problems, preventing the execution of any E.A. games linked to it. The only way to solve the problem (and I say beforehand - it is not a definitive solution, since this problem repeats itself), is to uninstall the Origin application together with all the games and reinstall everything again. The big consequence of this: games which do not allow cloud saves lose all the progress and everything needs to be restarted.<br>
			The combination of these factors justifies the reason why I have totally changed the channel's agenda. This new agenda, however, I will inform you, is not fixed or definitive, changes may occur as my desire and if necessary.<br>
			Regarding the series already started, see the following table to cgeck my proposal of "workaround" to resume them:
			<table class="ui celled table">
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th class="three column wide">Game</th>
						<th class="thirteen column wide">Proposal</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td class="middle aligned">Blade and Soul and<br>Secret World Legends</td>
						<td>Because the focus of my channel is to progress with the main story of the games, whenever a new update for the story appears, new gameplays will be made as a sequel to it. The necessary adjustments in our schedule will be made when updates to these games are released.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="middle aligned">Paladins and Overwatch</td>
						<td>The gameplays of these two games are to get out of the routine. These titles, among others from the same gender, that allow fast game play and has no story continuation can and will be done according to my needs.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="middle aligned">Mass Effect Trilogy</td>
						<td>The gameplays of <b>Mass Effect 1</b> were already concluded. A continuation of the trilogy (<b>Mass Effect 2</b> and <b>Mass Effect 3</b>) is being planned, but <b>Mass Effect 2</b> gameplays needs to be restarted. The existing videos of <b>Mass Effect 2</b> will be removed from my channels as soon as we restart this series. When that will happen, it's still a mystery, since, as I said earlier, Origin's application has several instabilities preventing any E.A. games associated with Origin from being played. As long as these instabilities are not remedied, I run the risk of restarting this project and losing all my progress by having to reinstall everything, causing me to restart everything else ONCE MORE. There are also plans for future acquisition of <b>Mass Effect Andromeda</b>. When it happens, I will transform the design of this series from a trilogy to a "quadrilogy". The decisions in respect of this depend solely on E.A. to present a definitive solution to these instabilities and different "reinstall everything associated with Origin."</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="middle aligned">Dragon Age Trilogy</td>
						<td>The same considerations about the issues with the Origin application justify the indefinite pause in the continuation of this series, coupled with the fact that the videos in this series will be removed from the channel as soon as possible. Remember that the series was interrupted precisely because of one of these instabilities that forced me to reinstall the Origin application, reinstall the game and have lost all progress, making it impossible to continue this series without a total restart.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="middle aligned">Tom Clancy's The Division</td>
						<td>Considering that <b>The Division</b> is an online game whose progress is automatically saved, the gameplay of this game will be resumed as live streams. Existing videos for the series will be removed from the channel (as soon as possible), since a new character will be created for this new series of gameplays.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="middle aligned">NieR: Automata</td>
						<td><b>NieR: Automata</b> series, originally started as something to "fill in an empty space" after problems with <b>The Division</b> will be resumed in the future in the form of a series of pre-recorded videos. The current videos existing in the channel will be removed and a new gameplay will be started for this project.</td>

		<h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">Why using three different streaming platforms?</h1><br>
		<h4>
			The answer to that question is not as simple as it sounds.<br>
			Before posting a true opinion, I am still evaluating all the possibilities, opinions and suggestions given by people that I consider. While I am in the process of evaluating, looking for new partners to grow together, play together and offer mutual help, this is how I plan to organize my content on these platforms will be as follows:
			<ul>
				<li><b>YouTube:</b> The YouTube channel will ONLY be used for pre-recorded gameplay videos, vLogs/VoD storage, compilations from my live clips or series of finished games.</li>
				<li><b>Twitch:</b> The Twitch channel will be my main channel for streams. All streams scheduled will be made LIVE directly to Twitch.</li>
				<li><b>Mixer:</b> It's an experimental channel. Twitch streams will be replayed in real time in <b>Mixer</b> allowing people who have Mixer accounts to interact with me during my lives. This also allows and gives the opportunity for multiplatform players to join my gameplays in lives, when that opportunity appears, since for access to the Mixer, an XLive account is required.</li>
			</ul>
