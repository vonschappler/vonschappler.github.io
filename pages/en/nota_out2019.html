			To begin with it, I first need to point out a few things, which are the things I will detail on this note:
			<ul>
				<li>I am STILL working on a schedule - the base schedule remains the same I used to stream before the long break I had to take, but starting the streaming sessions a bit earlier than before.</li>
				<li>My initial plan is to stream a Main Game three times per week and have a random game on the other day. This is mainly for my OWN HEALTH, so I don't get tired of playing the same game every session.</li>
				<li>Currenty, for my comeback to streaming I am dealing with LOTS of issues (both from my ISP and my own computer). Sadly I can't change ISP because here we have just a single ISP that gives me the real potential internet connection to stream. With this in mind, just remember that DISCONNECTS are expected during my stream sessions. As for my computer issues, those also can't be fixed by the moment of this post. Another issue and this one I HAVE CONTROL over it are a few broken links that are being reworked and will be updated when this rework is completed.</li>
				<li>Because I am affiliated to Extra Life, I will do a charity stream. The goal is to raise funds for hospitals that take care of kids. You can check info about this on the "Extra Life 2019" post, under the News page.</li>
			</ul>

			So - most of you don't know, but the life of a streamer is not easy (especially when you are doing all by yourself). Streaming, overlay editing, video editing, command editing for the bots, scripting, website editing, social media management, modding, advertising, supporting other streamers. Those are just a few things that I (at least I can say about MYSELF) have to do.<br>
			Time management to fit all this into the IRL stuff is really a thing that we have to do. For that mean, I decided to start my stream sessions earlier than I was used to. I am still getting used to this new starting time, as I know you all are also. This isn't for sure an easy task, but it is what it is. We all have do adapt and with this adapt process, it comes evolution - which is my main goal: allow each one of us, as a community, to evolve as a person (and myself evolve also as a streamer).

		<div class="ui divider"></div>
		<h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">About the games I will play</h1><br>
		<h4>
			As stated previously, my plans for my comeback to stream is mainly picking a game that will focus for the most and select a random game just to vary a bit. I also mentioned that I am doing this for my own mental health. I won't enter details here about my mental health, but playing mainly a single game get me stressed FAST, especially when the game becomes too challenging to a point I can't stand that challenge - and trust me, I like to challenge myself a lot when playing games, as you could see last year when I was playing the F.E.A.R collection in the HARDEST mode allowed by the game.<br>
			So, in short, after doing so many tweaks to the streaming app, looking for the "best game settings which would allow me to stream with a reasonable quality". I am the guy that focus in quality over quantity and because of that, I HAVE TO ADMIT a few things:<br>

			<ul>
				<li>I am happy to return, although I am not happy with the current quality of my streams. I was used to stream @1080p with 30fps/60fps (depending on the game), always streaming on the best image quality for the game. Now I have to stream @720p with 30fps, playing games with the lowest graphics quality and this annoys me a bit.</li>
				<li>Picking the lowest graphical settings for some games STILL cause them to consume A LOT of my CPU and GPU usage during streaming (and also affects my gameplay, because I lose so many details that are necessary for some games), causing the stream to skip a few frames when I am currently playing some FAST ACTION based games. This also makes me feel a bit annoyed, but it's what I can do for the moment.</li>
				<li>A recent incident caused my headset to break (I am used to playing games with 7.1 channel headset), and I had to get a damn cheap headset, stereo audio, and this IMPACTS a lot in the audio quality for both game and stream. So, until I get a similar (or better headset) to the one I used, the audio will be "silly". Again, this is a reason for some annoyance.</li>
			</ul><br>
			After digging around, making tests, adjustments and everything else in my reach, Table 1 can be used as a short explanation of the games I selected to play and why I picked them. For a detailed schedule, don't forget to check the Schedule post under the News page. That is the right place to see timers and changes I do to my schedule because it's linked to my streaming google calendar.<br>
			Just to conclude these thoughts, please don't get me wrong with all this complaining, I am just pointing facts here which are to explain what's going on RIGHT NOW (by the moment of this post/update).
		</h4>
		<div class="ui divider"></div>
		<h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">Current issues I am dealing with</h1><br>
		<h4>
			Let's begin this talking about "broken links" because this one is something easy to explain and will be fixed when possible. I mentioned before that all I do, have to do alone. I have a to-do list which I am working on my free time, and one of those things to do is fixing all my "shortened URLs", only because I decided to change my name on Twitch from vonSchapplerTV to von_Schappler. To be 100% honest with you, the current name is not YET the name I want, so more changes on the name will come as soon as it becomes available and this is the main reason of WHY I still haven't updated my shortened URLs. So, for the moment, most of my shortened links are broken and will remain broken for a while.<br>
			About my CPU, what I have to point currently is that I play and stream in an old rig (I mentioned this a few times already, but you can check details of my CPU configuration - at least the one I had before a few incidents that required me a few replacements for mouse, headset and other peripherals - on the Gaming page). With the new updates, games being developed to use the most powerful computer rigs and all of that gamers know about, it's really easy to guess that the game list I can play currently is going to get outdated and shortened. This is (sadly for us, as a community) something WE have to deal with until I can invest money on the stream itself.<br>
			Talking about my ISP, all I can detail, in advance, is that my current (and only possible ISP choice) is being a pain. After a few calls to the tech support of my ISP, this is what I could get as information from them:
			<ul>
				<li>There is a server to control DNS renews from users. This server is programmed to reset all connections older than 15 days as part of self-maintenance of the system.</li>
				<li>This connection reset USUALLY happens - for my luck - during the time I have free to stream, and usually on Sundays.</li>
				<li>With this reset, all in and out connections directly from my CPU to Twitch and other online services get off for the duration of the system reset.</li>
			</ul>
			The big problem on all this "maintenance" is simple: on our last 3 stream sessions, this "maintenance" happened more than it should happen. Each of the previous sessions I got disconnect three times and that is now being a big problem. I contacted again the tech support of my ISP and they said it was necessary to update to my router (which they said should be completed TODAY - considering the date I am writing and posting this) and asked me to make tests. All WE can hope is that this is fixed. Aside from that, nothing else I can do.

		<h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">The charity stream will really happen?</h1><br>
		<h4>
			The answer is <span class="ui teal label">YES</span>! I am currently thinking about the best way to do this. I know that the intention is/was to join the 24h challenge stream, but health is not on point to do a 24h stream. So starting in November, I will run a few streams to fundraise and see if we can beat the goal of donations that I picked to support this cause. For those who know nothing about Extra Life, check the Extra Life post in the News page and lets work on this cause!<br>
			Watch out for future updates on my <a href="http://twitter.com/von_schappler" target="_blank">Twitter</a> to get ready for those set of charity streams! What sort of thing I will do for that - well, this is really a mystery even for me, because I have plans on how to do it, just not sure IF will be able to execute them. I have though, high hopes that WE will make it happen!
