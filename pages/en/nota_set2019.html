			After a long time away, I have to say that I owe all of you lots of answers. I am not sure I'll be able to answer all of them here, on this note, but if you want to ask me something, feel free to message me via <a href="mailto:vonschappler.gaming@gmail.com?subject=I want to know more...">e-mail</a> and I will gladly answer to it.<br>
			I will try to keep here on what I consider it's really important, to avoid making this note long.

		<h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">About the plans to 2019</h1><br>
		<h4>
			OK - everything is repeating again this year. Plans I made were not executed. I don't know if they will. What I am trying to say here is that after all the mess that is happening those on the last months, all the plans I made for this year were put aside and that made it really bad to my mental health.<br>
			I will open myself here - depression took control of my life since December of last year. I don't know if I already mentioned it here for my community, but last December lots of bad things happened to my life during the X-Mas eve. The details won't be posted here, as I said previously, to avoid this note for being long.<br>
			As it follows, I AM still trying to deal with my depression, lack of enthusiasm, I can even say lack of self-love or self-acceptation. I try so hard to hide those from everyone, or at least tried to hide this from most of the people I know, but it comes the time we have to be honest with ourselves and "embrace" this condition as a way to look for help.<br>
			As I posted in our last update, in jan/2019, streaming is/was not giving me what I wanted. Dispenses just increased and I ended bankrupt. Last July, I even considered suicide as a way to ease all this suffering that I AM put into. Although I am not a religious person - and nothing against those who believe in anything - I got a "second chance" to try doing it again. Of course, my situation didn't change. All the fears, bad feelings and emptiness live with me, but... well I got a second chance, I won't waste it.<br>
			I took a long time to decide whether it was worth or not to try again and well - here I am. I don't plan to enter details on this suicide thing. If you want to know more, feel free to ask. I don't think this is the place to talk about that.

		<h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">A little talk about failures and successes</h1><br>
		<h4>
			Since I decided to try again, to make use of this second chance I was given, I am taking one step after the other. I have spent my time reading more and listening more to what people have to say. I am trying to open my mind and heart to what's to come. I gave up making plans and dreaming, to avoid more frustration. Everything I want now is to go slow as I do things the way I want to do on that specific day.<br>
			This is why I am here, writing this note, updating my website and taking notes on what I have to change on my day-by-day baby steps. Those last months I tried to keep my mind busy playing games as much as possible, as a way to don't think about the problems I am living with. Truth to be told, unable to get a job (due to a lot of reasons, among them my mental health status and how scarce are job offers where I live), this is where streaming comes.<br>
			So, evaluating my progress on streaming I could say that:
			<ul>
				<li>I failed with this community for not being active.</li>
				<li>I succeeded in earning the affiliate status last year, with all the support I got from you.</li>
				<li>I failed in bringing contents that this community would enjoy.</li>
				<li>I (feel that I) succeeded in giving my best during the time I took to stream.</li>
				<li>I failed for being myself and keeping my usual behavior when I shouldn't/</li>
				<li>I succeeded in making new friends for the time being in those streaming sessions.</li>
			</ul>
			I guess that I won't see many of you again, but be assured that when you come back to visit me, you will be welcome to my place. I hope that with my return I make new friends, that I find ma place in the streaming business because THAT is where I want to succeed.

		<h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">When will I return?</h1><br>
		<h4>
			Let's start this by not making any promises. I don't know when I'll return. I just know that I will. As I said before, I am taking baby steps. Suffice to say that the first step I am taking now, in writing this note to keep you guys updated.<br>
			The next step is to rework my schedule. For this, your feedback is pretty much appreciated. I don't know what to do and what will I do. Advises and suggestions are welcome in this matter. Until I get some solid feedback, I will just work offline, doing small changes where I see fit - overlays, bot commands, game selections, stream stress tests... Yes, this also: we need to remember that MY current PC rig is old and I can't do that much as I wanted to do in the begin. So, restart low, restart small and see how things will progress from there.<br>
			One thing is for sure. I am going to review what's left on my channel, do a cleanup, rework a few panels there, watch all my VoDs and see what will and won't remain there. I want to begin anew. For that, I think the past has to be erased.<br>
			Most of the decisions I took in the past won't remain. I need to change. I will change with your help, support and feedback. Will I be playing games I already played? Maybe. Will I make a full series of gameplays as I did with F.E.A.R. series? Who knows? There are though a few things that I want to make clear:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Altough I want to make contents that my community enjoy, I don't plan to play games I hate.</li>
				<li>I still don't know if I will stick to a single game, playing one main game and doing community days once per week/month or if I will continue as a variety streamer.</li>
				<li>I will take all the feedback with care, even though I won't be doing everything suggested. That is my space, the place I have to do what I want, the way I want. Feedbacks are welcome, but they don't mean I will follow all of them if they are not FIT to what I am doing.</li>
				<li>I will continue making my usual [(brk)en/pt] stream model. That means, broken English with my broken accent and Portuguese, which is my mother language.</li>
			</ul>

		<h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">About the current game selction</h1><br>
		<h4>
			I don't have currently a list of possible candidates for streaming. I still have not taken the time to check CPU and GPU usage when I have both game and other streaming software running. Also, I have to consider the post-render process - what will be sent to the stream. This also uses CPU/GPU - and this is my biggest concern, because, on my last stream session, I was playing locally my game at 60FPS, but on stream, there were having frame drops even though the streaming software didn't show it on the stats.<br>
			With this in mind, when I feel ready to stream, I'll post on my <a href="http://bit.ly/vonSchapplerTwitter" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and you guys can join me during these tests and give your feedback about the image and sound quality.
			During those tests, of course, IF I find fit to my content, I can pre-record some content and post as a video either on Twitch or my YouTube channel. Which is something I have yet to decide IF I'll do/continue doing.<br>
			Again, for not having yet decided if I will play just one game, various games or whatever, this is just another factor for not having a "candidate list" for games I will/can stream. Just let's keep something in mind: I enjoy playing games for the lore/history itself. Sticking to a single game, in this case, will be something "hard" to do, but if it comes to this point, so be it.<br>
			Another thing we have to keep in mind: if the game I chose to stream causes my CPU and GPU to be overconsumed, I will either be forced to reduce the quality visual of what's being streamed or stop streaming it and step back on that game until I have the power to replay it again.

		<h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">About my "identity" and niche</h1><br>
		<h4>
			As a streamer, it's hard to find our place/niche/identity in this big community. So far, after evaluating my contents, I saw I had no identity. I was part of no community. I had no niche. This made (and still is going to make) my life in here complicated.<br>
			I am looking forward to getting new partners, people to support me and offer them my support, and if that's the case, create my own niche, if I can't fit a specific niche. This is where you, my fellow friends, as a community, are important. Your support by taking your time to check up on me, visit my discord server, watching my contents, giving feedback is what is going to help me to make decisions on this matter.<br>
			Remember that, although this is my space, I can't make it alone. The final decision is mine, but your suggestions were, are and will always be appreciated.<br>
			Currently, all I can say is that I am reworking on my brand (if I have ever had one) and use this as my start point to come back.
