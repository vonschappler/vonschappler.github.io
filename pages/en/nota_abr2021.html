            Hello everyone!<br>
            Yeah, this note title says everything - three months of silence and the failed promise to update those notes more
            frequently. Well, that happened for a reason: things around here were quite busy - far way more than I could expect. At least this
            "radio silence" was for a good reason!<br>
            After many things that happened around here, I came to some decisions which I plan to detail on this note. Most importantly is those
            decisions may affect me in both good and bad ways, but I really have/had to give it a try, instead of only get stuck on the "What if..." thoughts.<br>
            Let's begin with the fact that my mental health was getting even worse than before, especially, after my old PC "was done for". 
            That made me take a quick action so I really could feel myself - at least - stable again (mentally speaking). This was the trigger for me to act
            "desperately", because I really saw myself in a worse spot than I already was. The main action was the start a set of chain-reactions which I
            will detail on this note.

        <h4>
            I mentioned on our last note about a number of goodies I got from my awesome community members - one of those things were the PC parts, which I decided not to
            put together after analyzing technical aspects of the pieces sent. Well, when my PC broke to the point of no possible fix, I had to do something or I would go
            deeper into a depressive state. I saw myself in a place the only way to avoid it was to get those parts and find a way to "work around" with them.<br>
            Again, I have total conscience those parts are not able to give me support to my rhythm, but it is what I have here now - so why not put them to work?
            I got some pieces here, other pieces there and made a "basic" PC rig - so now I have again a computer here with me.<br>
            The computer I have here now does not support me in the ways my old PC would, but look at this! I managed to get back to streaming! Not only that but
            also there are some new things I will share later in this note. The first stress test for the computer (streamwise) was on Feb/03/2021. I ran a few more stress
            tests with various games before then deciding I could stream back again!<br>
            I had the help of some people during those stress test streams, so they could help me with accurate feedback on how things were going from the "viewer" end.
            I have to admit I was (and still am) in a mix of joy and excitement - although I knew I would still not able to keep doing what I did before, the way I did before.
            But in the end, things are happening, in baby-steps, but happening. Hope is now, again, part of my life. The hope I will be able to get everything as I
            always wanted and make streaming a full-time job, so I will not anymore depend on the things I was used to working with before.<br>
            I can't forget to mention that a few days after I got back to streaming, my Husky Series headset got damaged. As a consequence, I tried to set up a Corsair series
            headset which was part of the PC parts I got. Truth be told, the headset didn't work properly. It was capturing all sounds played in my ears by the microphone
            and that forced me to stream with a mobile phone mic/earbud set since then. After doing some research about this issue, I discovered it was really something caused by the
            headset itself, and replacing it would not fix it - too many other users complaining about the same thing.<br>
            Right now, it's been more than 15 days now I am streaming like this. So if you wish (and can) help me to get something better than this mic/earbud stuff for streaming,
            considering make a donation <a href="http://rebrand.ly/vonDonations" target="_blank">here</a>. This won't really be something just for me, but for you
            as well, as a community member of my stream channel, because it will help in stream quality improvements - that's for sure!

            Even with all the pros and cons mentioned before, I NEED to keep trying. And here I am, trying something new. It seems that finally, I will be able to
            give life to my <a href="http://rebrand.ly/vonYouTube">YouTube Channel</a>. I probably (at this point), have taken a bigger step than I should, risking
            falling down if I miss following steps I need to walk in this path, but again, I had to stop being stuck on the "what if..." thoughts.<br>
            Even aware of my financial condition, and after having serious conversations with some people, I decided to acquire a new game for my collection. This is one
            of the few times I buy games in those "pre-sale" offers we have around there, but IT WAS WORTH the try, I must say. As my psychologist mentioned
            lots of times to me: "It's always worth to try and learn with the mistakes then get inert and later being tormented by the <code>'I should have done this when
            I could...'</code> thought.<br>
            I can name the few games I bought in situations like this:
            <ul>
                <li>Cyberpunk 2077</li>
                <li>Destiny 2 (Shadowkeep and Beyond Light expansions)</li>
                <li>Guild Wars 2</li>
                <li>Vampire Bloodlines 2</li>
            </ul>
            but now, this list has another title: <code>Outriders</code>. Yes, you read it right! I bought "Outriders", which will be released on Apr/01/2021, and this will
            be the entrance for me to get my YouTube Channel active.<br>
            Before getting my hands on the full game, I played the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/680420/OUTRIDERS/" target="_blank">demo</a> of the game
            and then took the decision to use that as a possible source to create content for the channel. The first real content I created was a
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4pjTJwBVzU" target="_blank">review video</a> (this video has - as well as all other Outriders video will have - main
            audio in PT-BR, with subs in PT-BR for the deafen and EN-US for the non-Portuguese speakers) and my plan is to focus the most possible in creating content for
            this game!<br>
            At this moment, for doing it all by myself (recording, editing, writing subtitles, etc.), I still can't be sure or create a schedule for when to post this
            kind of content, so in between, I will add some "past stream" videos there, to keep the channel up and running in between each Outriders video upload.<br>
            Needless to say, since working on everything by myself, it will imply some important changes to my usual schedule, as I will detail in the next session
            of this note. I also can't forget about other things I do for this community - which are also done all by myself. Things like <code>setting new discord bots</code>,
            <code>creating interactivity tools for my streams</code>, <code>updating this website</code> are a few of those things I
            do, and they all demand the same attention as maintaining a YouTube Channel. I expect already things will get heavy on my shoulders - at least until I get used to
            all of these changes -, but I will be strong enough to carry on, and with your constant support, this will be a pleasure to work on all of this!

        <div class="ui divider"></div>
        <h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">Schedule Changes</h1><br>
        <h4>
            The new schedule change will feature <code>three</code> main things:
            <ul>
                <li><code>Less scheduled stream sessions on Twitch:</code></li>
                In order to keep this "engine" running, I will have to find some (extra) free time. The option I found for this was to reduce the number of weekly streams
                on Twitch. I know this can be bad news to some of you, but to make for the removal of some stream sessions, the scheduled stream sessions will have
                sightly longer duration. I hope to do it this way, it makes it easier to manage time for achieving everything I want!<br>
                <li><code>Removal of Discord server streams:</code></li>
                My Discord server streams didn't work as I planned. I was looking for a solution to them, I don't know, maybe rethinking the way I would
                make them happen, but instead, to give me more space on my new schedule, the final decision was to remove them.<br>
                Removing them, although do not imply I won't make them anymore. It means they won't be part of my pre-defined schedule and for this only reason, I may or
                may not host sporadically sessions there. So, to be short on this, those sessions are being removed from my "fixed" schedule and are now converted to
                casual sessions, to be hosted when possible and/or at my will.<br>
                <li><code>Addition of a extra stream (the "return" of community nights):</code></li>
                Another important change is the "return" of community nights. I tried to add this to my streams a while ago, but without success - I have to say - which
                made me remove them from my streams a long time ago. These community nights will from now on be organized ONLY inside my
                <a href="http://rebrand.ly/vonDiscord" target="_blank">Discord Server</a> with the help of one of the recently added bots it it.<br>
                These nights will feature mainly <code>two</code> parts:
                <ol>
                    <li><code>A "backstage" (informative) stream:</code></li>
                    This part of the stream will be mostly what I do in backstage to keep my life as a streamer. I'll chat while showing part of what I do to give this community
                    the best and most professional content. Coding scripts, part of the process of updating this website, maybe some art creation - who knows? But my main purpose
                    with this is to show everyone what I do when I am not streaming!<br>
                    <li><code>The "game time":</code></li>
                    This part of the stream will be (of course) made for fun - this will be the part where WE will play together. For this to happen, a free game or any game
                    with interactivity features will be chosen, so everyone can join this part of the stream even more actively than only chatting! As mentioned before, this
                    will be organized insidem my Discord server, so the only <code>two</code> requirements to those who wish to participate these community nights are:
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>To be a Follower of my Twitch stream channel</code></li>
                        <li><code>To be a Discord Sever member</code></li>
                        (because no other information about those events will be given outside it, as already mentioned)
                    </ul>
                </ol>
            </ul>
            Remember my schedule is always available on this website (under the "Schedule" navigation bar) and from now on, it also can be accessed (for your convenience)
            <a href="http://rebrand.ly/vonScheduleEN" target="_blank">here</a> and those schedule changes will start on Apr/04/2021.
