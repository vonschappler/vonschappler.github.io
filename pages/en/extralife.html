				Now if you ask ME, <u>von Schappler</u>, how I would describe it, the only word I think about is: "humanity". What else could we say when we have a chance to help those in need, by doing what we like to do, and achieve it? Since 2008, Extra Life (in partnership with gamers) has fundraised more than $50 million for treating sick and injured kids. That's really a good cause... I can relate to that for having a nephew at the age of 7 and WE here - as his family, do what's on our reach to give him the proper support even if he has just a small scratch for falling when playing with his friends. Imagine then what would WE do if it was one of those kids in need we could help by supporting Extra Life? That's how I felt when I joined Extra Life for the first time, last year. I felt exactly as if I was helping my nephew, especially after I watched a few videos with the touching histories of kids they helped!<br>

				The true thing is: most people think that streaming it's just to get to a computer, "sit there pretty" (with a nice makeup, if you are a girl), play games, rage and 'beg' for money/donations/subscribers. Well, that may be true for some streamers. But that's not true for the majority of this community. We have a huge backstage work to do when not streaming: support other streamers, look for partnerships, deal with "IRL" stuff on the "free time"... But one of those backstage work is exactly helping those social projects/campaigns - such as Extra Life.<br>

				Some of us have streaming as our ONLY job and "begging" for donations is what is going to pay our bills. Other streamers play games online for other people to watch, just for fun. Another group of streamers is there to help sick people by offering them the safe space of "anonymity" to talk openly about their problems as a way to feel better. But there is ONE common to all of us: WE ENJOY DOING IT, no matter the reason why we stream! And on the same we enjoy streaming, we enjoy showing everyone that WE ARE ALSO HUMAN BEINGS who work in support of good causes - and thanks to Extra Life, we have another chance to show it for everyone!<br>

				Well, considering their slogan, "Play games, heal kids.", that is what WE can do. We spread the word about this campaign as we are playing/watching our favorite streamers, support Extra Life channels on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ExtraLife4Kids" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/extralife4kids" target="_blank">Twitch</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ExtraLife4Kids" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/ExtraLife4Kids" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, on the same we make donations for the cause, if and when possible.<br>
				<br>
				For me, as a streamer, I will be taking donations on my <a href="http://bit.ly/vonSchapplerTwitch" target="_blank">Twitch channel</a> during my streams and from each <a href="https://streamlabs.com/vonschapplertv" target="_blank">direct donation</a> I get this year from 03/01/2019 to 10/31/2019, I'll take 10% of it to give in to this cause. Also, if everything goes as planned, on Nov 2, 2019, I will host a 24h challenge stream, with the hashtag #ForTheKids and 20% of my direct donations will be sent to Extra Life.<br>
				<br>
				If you want to donate directly to Extra Life and support me as a streamer, you can also make your donation by clicking the thermometer on the right side of this page! Any amount is appreciated and trust me, those kids we will help together will always be grateful for what we have done here!<br>
				<br>
				Remember that donations are not refundable, so if donate ONLY if you are inclined to do so. When you do it, do with with the certainty that you are doing the right thing to help those who really need this help!
