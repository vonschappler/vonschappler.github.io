            Hello guys! I know it's being a while I don't update this website. I missed Nov/2019 update notice, but
            instead of posting an update note like this, I updated the website with a brand new script I wrote for
            <a href="https://streamlabs.com/chatbot" target="_blank">Streamlabs Chatbot</a> (standalone version). If you
            want to know more about this script, don't forget to check our Downloads page.<br>
            So many things have happened in those two months. Most importantly, and this is also some sort of explanation about why
            I haven't been active as a streamer in the past weeks: weather changes along the years are affecting a lot here in the
            region I live in. In short, we are already used to have lots of storms around here during our summer
            (here is now summer by now) with LOTS of lightning strikes. The problem is that this specific region is affected
            a lot by those lightning strikes, to the point we are unable to contact the "outer world" for the duration of the
            storm (and most of the times even after it, because of damaged equipment).<br>
            These storms are affecting my schedule for two main reasons:
            <ul>
                <li>Weather (here) is changing suddenly from a sunny and hot day to a cloudy and stormy one in a matter of
                    minutes.</li>
                <li>Storms are getting stronger each new day and lightning strikes are being more common than usual with each
                    storm and, as I stated before, those strikes cause the whole region to be 100% without contact with the "outer
                    world" by phone, mobiles and/or internet services.
                </li>
            </ul>
            The second reason I mentioned above is what worries you most. These lightning strikes are making people lose their equipment
            (TVs, computers, refrigerators - anything connected by a power cord to the electrical network) and I'm afraid of losing my
            computer because if that happens, I won't be able to fix/replace it anytime soon. I also need to mention here that my ISP
            (and the only one I can use/have here, as this is the only active ISP in the region due to a government-defined reason)
            is being a real nuisance to me when it comes to streaming - which means we never know when I can do an entire stream session
            without random disconnects and/or if I can get back this session if I get disconnected. These disconnections are often happening
            to me, forcing me to try to come back until I give up (if I can't get back online) or just can't reconnect, and as a streamer,
            that's annoying me for many reasons I won't detail here.

        <h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">Being transparent with my community</h1><br>
        <h4>
            We know that we need to be as transparent as possible with our community and for this reason I am
            writing this. We are still a small community, but transparency means all to me. This community knows that my main goal with streaming
            is being a fulltime/professional streamer and it's being hard to do that by myself. I rely on this community to help me to achieve
            this goal.<br>
            People really don't have a clue on what is to be a streamer: sleepless nights planning, testing, making tweaks, looking/praying
            for support(ers) to help in streaming improvements, managing social media, trying to interact with other communities, setting up alerts,
            creating commands for a chatbot, manage stream chat (which is harder when you don't have any moderators available), managing
            goals, updating landing page... In my specific case, add to this list: coding, drawing, updating this website, deal with ISP issues
            90% of the time being, editing videos, trying to make my own clips and highlights, and this list just gets bigger as I make new
            plans to my stream, as I try to be a better streamer, the streamer this community deserves. Ah, don't get me wrong, but IF you
            want to become a professional streamer, all that HAS TO BE part of your routine and trust me, it makes me feel sad that MOST PEOPLE don't
            do 1/10 of this and are more successful than I am right now and this is why I have, though, to admit here a few things before moving
            to the next section of this note:
            <ul>
                <li>Although I like streaming, I am really frustrated with the current status of my streams and I NEED the feedback
                    of this community with tips on how to improve my streams. If you don't know, we have a
                    <a href="https://rebrand.ly/vonSurveyEN" target="_blank">survey</a> where you can give your feedback, you can
                    contact me using <a href="https://rebrand.ly/vonDiscord" target="_blank">Discord</a> or using any other means to give me
                    this feedback. You really don't need to be afraid, I am an open-minded person and I will take all considerations with care
                    and apply them IF they are something I can apply on my streams.</li>
                <li>Although I like streaming, it's becoming more and more painful to me sitting on a chair like
                    <a href="https://http2.mlstatic.com/banquinho-madeira-banco-banqueta-tamborete-verniz-50cm-D_NQ_NP_167905-MLB25083469164_102016-F.jpg"
                        target="_blank">this</a>
                    for long periods of time (for both streaming and doing all of the "side work" a streamer has to do). I really
                    need better "streaming gear" (I think I can call the whole setup like this) in order to continue.</li>
                <li>Altough I know the importance of lurkers in a stream, having an active community is what really matters to me. I
                    am extremely shy and streaming for myself/lurkers is getting stressful and making me even sadder each stream session
                    I start.</li>
                <li>As part of interacting with my community, I have tried to be more active on Discord, working hard to make it
                    a real server for you, with lots of channels there and even with a small community, I think it would be really nice
                    if we could make use of this server.</li>
                <li>People don't know or forget to notice it, but streaming is not just "sit pretty" in a (gamer) chair and playing
                    games/doing whatever for people to watch. Support me or any other streamer you follow because WE work hard in the
                    background before pressing the "go live" or "start streaming" button in the streaming software. Also, keep in mind that when a
                    streamer is "by him/herself" most of the time, all the hard work is even harder. So really think about this before
                    you press the "Follow" button because streamers don't want numbers, WE want an active community even if it's a small one. If
                    you don't know how to support a streamer you follow, don't be afraid, ask him/her, read the panels on their landing page,
                    visit his/her stream when possible, and most IMPORTANTLY, interact with the streamer and his/her community when possible!</li>
                <li>I know that lately, I have used most of my "free time" to go coding scripts to make my bot behave as I want/need
                    to manage my stream the best way possible to make my streams more joyful. This has both positive and negative sides,
                    at least now in the "community growth" stage, but trust me, this is for the best in this stage of my streaming
                    career.</li>
                <li>I have tried to be more active on social media channels, but again, scripting FOR MY OWN STREAM is time-consuming.
                    No more is needed to be said about this.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>
            So, talking now about the rainstorms and lightning strikes and how this is going to affect our schedule, the least I can
            do is to provide update on my social media. Either my Discord and Twitter should have announcements about this. I will
            try to post those updates on both if possible, but as stated before when I am not streaming or doing the side work I have
            to do as a streamer, I am coding and the focus on this activity makes me run to the "easiest" social media I have access, Discord,
            in order to post any update. In short, this month/season schedule will follow like this:<br>

            I am updating stream goals this month to fulfill my wish of having (as a start point):
            <ol>
                <li>Small Goals
                    <ol>
                        <li>Have at least 5 active members during my stream sesions</li>
                        <li>Get some new games for streaming during the "history content" nights</li>
                        <li>Unlock new emotes slots</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Bigger Goal
                    <ol>
                        <li>Get donations to buy a <a href="https://static3.tcdn.com.br/img/img_prod/374123/cadeira_gamer_mad_racer_v12_madv12ptsdg_pcyes_29807_1_20190919145044.jpg" target="_blank">
                            MAD Racer V12 Chair</a> - it costs today (by the post of this page) something close R$1600.00</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
            If we achieve those goals, here is what's going to happen:
            <ul>
                <li>For each small goal achieved: I will host a 4h long stream, 75% donations in those streams will be sent to local charity and each donation
                    wth value equal or above R$5.00 will increase the duration of the stream in 30min, to the limit of 12h long.</li>
                <li>When we achieve the big goal, I will host a 24h long stream and 100% of donations on that stream will be sent to local charity.</li>
            </ul>
            So if you want better quality, want to support me or even want to support charity institutions, let's get those goals together!

            I am sorry to disappoint my community, the kids, and ExtraLife, but both my physical and mental health won't allow me to do
