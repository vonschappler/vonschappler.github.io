            How's everyone doing? I hope everything is right out there! I have to admit, lately, I've been concerned about a lot of things, but mostly about health, in general.<br>
            I really don't like to touch this subject, but as many of you know, WE ARE STILL suffering from this COVID-19 pandemic. Since the last time I posted a note here, too many "close people" were deceased, due to it. One of them was my next-door neighbor. I never thought I would see the COVID-19 SO CLOSE! So, thinking about how things are really taking this scale, I thought it was time to take this time to add this note here, talking about (my) general (and mental) health, so those who follow me will have some relief that things are all right here.<br>
            So in this note, I'll not only talk about plans, works, and something else but also about HEALTH.

        <h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">Starting with some changes...</h1><br>
        <h4>
            I have worked a lot lately in order to make things better. My initial plans to reactivate my <a href="http://rebrand.ly/vonYouTube" target="_blank">YouTube Channel</a> didn't work as I predicted. I invested some time in creating content about the game Outriders, but due to plenty of issues with the game, this had to be delayed until the game was playable again. I have announced this a few times, during my live streams on Twitch and on my <a href="http://rebrand.ly/vonDiscord" target="_blank">Discord Server</a>. In the past few weeks, Outriders is receiving some updates which are making the game playable again. As soon as the game is fully playable with minimal issues, I will return to create content to YouTube.<br>
            As for my streams, although I have planned to stick to create content mainly dedicated to Outriders, I am not sure YET if I should change this focus, considering how hard things are being harsh to "small communities" within the platform. Decisions at this point are being hard to be taken, considering the actual status of the platform. Although I have a huge library of games - which keeps increasing by those giveaways, game developers campaigns, and gifts given by some community members, it's being hard for me to make a solid decision on which game I should focus "community wise". The market seems always oversaturated on every choice I make and growing as a community gets harder and harder.<br>
            You know, the full-time job as a content creator is a dream the remains, a dream I still fight for it, but at this specific time, I lack the creativity to make things different to offer everyone the best I can. With this in mind, I am really opened to suggestions, which you can provide either on my Discord Server (there is a channel intended for this) or by filling this <a href="http://rebrand.ly/vonSurveyEN" target="_blank">survey</a>. All suggestions will be taken under consideration, and if applicable, of course, I will make use of them.<br>

        <div class="ui divider"></div>
        <h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">... and talking about the chatbot scripts</h1><br>
        <h4>
            Still talking about the last topic, and adding some new things to my stream sessions, it's been a while since I updated the <code>downloads section</code> of this website. The reason for this is - I have not created something "new" for publishing. I have to say, though, I've worked a few times on commissioned scripts and such, and this is why I had little time to come out with something new to share with the community. Now that I have completed most of those commissioned scripts, I guess its time to start coding things for personal use and other new things to share with YOU, fellow streamers.<br>
            But, before working on something new, my starting plans are to improve the ones already shared, fixing bugs, adding new functionality to them, and THEN, just after this job is done, I will start on something new. I have already dedicated time to code a few things for personal use these past months. Some of those I would like to share with everyone, and I will share, as soon as I find a way to make them work in a friendly way.<br>
            So I came then with an idea: <em>I'll start accepting commissions for new Streamlabs Chatbot scripts, charging a small fee for creating them</em>. So, starting today, I am opening commissions for <code>StreamLabs Chatbot Scripts</code>. IF you are an user of this chatbot, feel free to submit your commission <a href="http://rebrand.ly/vonChatbotScriptcommissionEN" target="_blank">here</a>!
            <div class="ui message" style="text-align: center;">
                    Prices for commissioned Streamlabs Chatbot Scripts may vary based on the complexicity of the code written<br>
                    and requirements for specific overlays, in case they are needed. All the details are provided on the link above.
            </div>
            <br>
            With this new "concept", I plan to rework my stream sessions in order to make them more oriented to coding those chatbot scripts during them and showing part of this process. By doing this, streams will be less gaming-oriented then. This change HAS TO and WILL happen naturally, as the stream subject/category will depend mostly on my mood on that day.

        <div class="ui divider"></div>
        <h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">Time to talk about health</h1><br>
        <h4>
            This is going to be a "touchy" subject.<br>
            The reason I say this, it's mainly because it's NEVER easy to talk about health - especially in these days where we all are being affected by this pandemic. Well, we all know how this pandemic is really affecting us in different ways. Each individual is dealing with it as they can, and so am I. I have already mentioned countless times (and I won't stop saying this, although not entering again on details about it): it's hard for me to get a formal job. It always was and with this pandemic things got even worse.<br>
            Health is being taken care, as much as possible. But lately, I am experiencing a strong downside, when it comes to streaming - and this downside is turning taking care of myself into a hellish day-by-day activity. This downside is making me want to give up on EVERYTHING, truth to be told. I don't get tired of saying this: "Stream is my main and only job.", but it's not being something worth lately. I'll detail a few things and then it will be possible to understand the reasons I am experiencing this downside:
            <ul>
                <li><em>Lack of a proper feedback/support:</em></li>
                When it comes to streaming/content creation, ANY feedback is welcome. The problem is when someone, as a content creator, receives none. This is the actual scenario I am dealing with. I get no feedback anywhere. Even though I keep looking for it, mostly politely requesting some feedback from people I know and trust they'd say the truth, I simply get none. It's hard then to know what and if there is something I could/should change when there is no feedback to give hints on what can be improved on/removed from the content produced.<br>
                When it comes to supporting, I am not talking about money (but also about it). Supporting a streamer is not only "to give money" - although money is important and welcome, hence streaming is a job paid only via the goodwill of those watching it. It's always possible to support simply by watching the stream sessions, interacting with the streamer, being active as a community member, helping the community to grow, interacting with new members, and, of course, helping in advertise when possible.<br><br>
                <li><em>Everything is a hard work and it's not properly valued by the others:</em></li>
                Streaming is hard work. Making a website is hard work. Learning how to set up a Discord server and setting it is hard work. Learning how to deal with chatbots and roles in a streaming scenario is hard work. Making videos is hard work. Setting a schedule and being consistent with it is hard work. In short, EVERYTHING related to stream/content creation is as hard as anything can be in any other profession, but (in general) all this work does not receive the right value/recognition from those who consume this kind of product.<br>
                It's a shame that people usually don't see things like they really are. They tend to see that streaming is "nothing more" than open a game, sit in front of a webcam and share their screen while playing the opened game. If you are one of those who think like that, let me ask you a few questions, so you can get what I am trying to say:<br><br>
                <ol>
                    <li><em>Have you ever considered the human needs of a streamer?</em> (a bit of money-talk)</li>
                    While some out there stream "for fun", this is not the rule. Those are the exception! Most of us are in this trying to make streaming our profession, for many different reasons. We ALSO have human needs - feeding, socializing, bills to pay, medical needs, etc. Keep in mind that people like me are working hard as streamers to fulfill those human needs and this is mainly where financial support is welcome to streamers and content creators. I am not saying that "YOU" have any obligation to pay for this "provided service", but that WHEN/IF possible, payment is really welcome and will be used with all joy by those in need! Ah, there is here one important thing: I forgot the countless times I saw those "streaming for fun" having absurdly high "donation goals" to "acquire unnecessary stuff" they could get by other means and achieving those goals, while other people with small goals, some of them only to be able to buy their next meal not being able to achieve them. Are now "futilities" more important than human needs?<br><br>
                    <li><em>Have you ever considered the amount of background job is done when a (trully dedicated) streamer is not in a live session?</em></li>
                    First, let's explain the "truly dedicated" part: I am not here trying to make any distinction but, in my honest opinion, those who stream "only for fun", do not show the dedication needed, if compared to those trying to make streams their living. (Everyone has an opinion about it, this is mine and on the same you have yours and I respect it, I ask you to respect this personal conjecture.) Now, to the real thing: only a few people truly acknowledge the work done in the background, not only by me but for most of those who stream and create content by themselves. Those few I mentioned are mostly other streamers or close friends to streamers who follow up their paths, fights, good and bad moments before, during, and after each stream session.<br><br>
                    <li><em>Have you ever considered how many streams someone have done without a proper meal?</em></li>
                    I guess no one has considered that some streaming schedules are so tight in time that skipping meals may be a thing. This is why, sometimes, you see streamers having to either eat during the stream or take breaks to get their meals. And here comes the problem: most people seem to DON'T understand that EATING is one of the human needs I mentioned before and when/if a streamer has to take a break to fulfill this need, they simply leave the chatroom. When the streamer is back from this break, he is then alone. This is the WORST FEELING EVER any streamer (small or not) can experience.<br><br>
                    <li><em>Have you ever considered how many streams someone did ONLY to keep the "required" consistency on their schedule?</em></li>
                    I am SURE many have never wondered if a streamer/content creator was really doing great on every stream session and maybe if they wondered about it, they never offered the proper support to make things "at least" a little better and make the streamer day a bit better. I am not saying streamers have any kind of obligation in following schedules. It's hard to predict life itself and sometimes, stream breaks may be necessary.<br>
                    What I am saying is that even though there isn't such obligation (we) streamers feel obliged in following a schedule as a compromise to the community we have/are building and this (as it happens on any job) may end in those days where a specific stream session is happening only because there is a set schedule for it. It does not mean that because the streamer is there, joking and laughing, that things are all right with their lives. <em>Think about it and do your best to support them!</em> We really need each tiny support directed towards our hard job, as anyone would need in any other professional environment.<br><br>
                </ol>
                What I am trying to say with all that?<br>
                Simple! Most people refuse to see what's going on behind a stream session. They don't see the time dedicated to learning how to stream better and with better quality; the things we need to buy in order to make streaming a good experience for them; the time we dedicate for this job while we are not streaming (for me, right now, I am dedicating time to update this website, which is also a part of my streaming job); the bills we have to pay; how exhausting streaming can be, both physically and mentally; our emotional state before, during and after streaming. The ones who refuse to see all that simply lack the respect for the human behind the camera, taking a streamer, most of the time, as a toy they can discard later and get a new one, hence the number of new streamers out there.<br>
                <div class="ui message" style="text-align: center;">
                    Remember, there is plenty of ways to support a streamer as I already mentioned.<br>
                    Make use of the way(s) YOU CAN and do your best to support because the streamer is also doing his best for YOU!
                </div>
                But, instead of providing any support to this hard work, this is how people behave (especially towards small/new streamers):
                <ul style="list-style: none">
                    <li>a) <em>"I'll say 'Hi!' to this streamer and leave without saying anything, just to have him talking to himself."</em></li>
                    (<i class="arrow up icon"></i> Many do this intentionally, while others because they needed. It's easy to recognize the difference between those because the ones who did to attend any needs, will return back saying something and showing some appreciation to our hard work.)
                    <li>b) <em>"I'll 'drop a follow', I won't say anything if they call me or show appreciation for the follow, and then unfollow later without saying anything at all."</em></li>
                    (<i class="arrow up icon"></i> This is something really common lately, no matter the size of the streamer community, and this kind of people don't even try to be part of that community to see what's about.)
                    <li>c) <em>"I'll follow this streamer only to never visit this channel again in my life (except to unfollow it) because all she/he needs is a number."</em></li>
                    (<i class="arrow up icon"></i> This one is not true! We, streamers, do not want numbers, we want a real and active community to share good and bad moments, as a family would do!)
                </ul>
                Well, yet again, I am working hard when not streaming in order to bring everything within my reach to life. I code unique Python scripts for my chatbot in order to make it more enjoyable for people to use; I set up a Discord Server for people to interact with each other; I have this website to post those things like this - but none of those things is currently being used by you - and I have to say, sometimes not even by me, because I keep working to improve those things, which leaves me almost with no time to make use of my own creations. <em>Keep in mind that I work hard for YOU to make use of those tools, not for me.</em><br><br>
                <li><em>Platforms do not offer the best support for those who are starting and wish to grow within them</em>:</li>
                The requirements to grow on each platform are really different each other, but one thing remains true: NONE of the requirements to grow up are easy to achieve when you are starting. These platforms (always) ignore the potential of those who are working hard (and most of the time by themselves) and (always) show/give support to those who are already "big" within it.<br>
                So, for the ones like me, the only support we have is ourselves and/or friends - and most of the time, not even this, hence the challenge turns (each new day) something almost impossible to oversee. I can talk for me, I am on this for more than 5 years... With <a href="http://rebrand.ly/vonTwitch" target="_blank">this</a> specific account, and those 5 years working as hard as possible and having (almost) no support from family, relatives, and EVEN from of those who I can call friends.<br><br>
                <li><em>Small streamers take too long to get their payments from streaming platforms</em> (a bit more of money-talk):</li>
                Each platform has a different way of payment and different requirements for paying for our hard job. They don't care about how hard we work, but they care if we give them money so they can pay us a <em>small share</em> of the money we give them. I can't due to "contractual clauses" enter in details on how much is paid - but I guess I can explain that most streaming/content sharing platforms pay us based on thresholds. For a new/small streamer, for example, these platform thresholds are something almost impossible to achieve on a monthly basis, and, well, some of them take months (maybe years) to reach these thresholds.<br>
                Needless to say that, in my case, for example, I took 4 years to reach the threshold necessary to receive my first payment, then my second payment was 1 year later and who knows when the third one will be credited (or even if it will be credited - the way things are going lately, it feels like it will never be credited).<br>
                That said, for "the new/small guys", lasts (mainly) to hope their community can provide some money income via "direct" donations (please note that those still have to be sent to a sort of "intermediary", such as PayPal, for example, but there is no threshold for us to withdraw these "direct donations") - other than paid methods that have to pass by the platform thresholds before receiving these earnings. The reason I say this is simple, even though they have to be sent via a virtual account, it's possible to retrieve the income within 3 working days, instead of waiting months (or years) when this "intermediary" is the platform itself.<br>
                We (streamers) need money to pay bills; to buy supplies; to improve streaming gear in order to make streaming better; to buy medicines; we have our mental health to be taken care of; etc. After all that bunch of words,  I think I don't need to say that all my efforts are providing no return - either financial or emotional/psychological - to help me "stand on my feet" and in the end, this is why taking care of myself is being also ANOTHER hard work (as if streaming was not hard enough to deal with).
            </ul>
            <div class="ui message">
                <div class="ui header">Conclusion:</div>
                IF you took your time to read through all this, think about anything you could do, not only for me but for ANY STREAMER OUT THERE (no matter the size of their community), and provide us (streamers) the best support you can, because this is all we need - YOUR SUPPORT on ANY WAY POSSIBLE, especially those who have special needs (as I do) and are taking streams as our main job to be able to fulfill those needs!
