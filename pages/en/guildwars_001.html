				What to say about the Guild Wars series? There are lots of details to be pointed out as far as the overall look of the game is concerned. I want to begin by praising the immersive gameplay that this series (as a whole) offers, bringing an extended open world to be explored (to get an idea of the extent of this world, <a href="https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/List_of_maps" target="_blank">click here</a>), besides several campaigns that compose this series.<br>
				<br>
				Analyzing all the publications for this series, we have a total of 11 titles from the launch of the first game (2005) until the most recent publication, an expansion pack for Guild Wars 2, among these publications 3 books that complement the magnificent story counted within this universe. However, I want to talk only about the "first part" of the series, which is formed by the games indicated in Table 01.

				I want to tell you about the reaction I had in my first contact with this game. Despite being a game released in 2005, I only had access to it in November 2015, two years after my first contact with the series, by playing Guild Wars 2. I literally felt a bit scare about it: "What do you mean devs, I can not to jump in this game? " - it was my tought every time I came across an obstacle that could easily be avoided with the "jumping" function of my character - after all, after two years playing Guild Wars 2 and making extreme use of "leaping" to jump over obstacles, it was natural to think that every obstacle would be overcome with a jump. What a illusion of mine. It took a while for me to get used to Guild Wars (and I still have some tight fights in there because of it). I even gave up playing Guild Wars several times. However, I would always play it again, hoping to unlock unique items for the second game of the series, as unlocking certain items which are linked to your account, giving me, the player, an incentive to "never give up."<br>
				<br>
				Fact is that by my nature as a player who does not like to remain stuck in any game, I left the game and tried to come back and... as you can imagine, I never managed to finish Guild Wars. I can not forget to mention that my biggest obstacle was (and still is) to consider the gameplay very stritc. Being used to dodging opponents' attacks, jumping on certain points and practically never finding an "invisible wall", are factors that make me think like that as long as I am playing the first Guild Wars. The truth is that I had (and still have) to put in my mind: "this game is the first in the series so I can not play the same way I play the second."<br>
				<br>
				Only when I put this in my mind will I finally be able to get used to this gameplay. This is being worked on because, whenever I can, I get one of my characters to try to move on in the story told in Guild Wars. I can not forget to mention here that the story is formed by an impressive and complex lore (which can be read in its instruction manuals - available for download in the <a href="https://www.guildwars.com/en/download" target="_blank">official site</a>) with a serie of calendars with historical events to help to situate the player at what time of the story he is "living".<br>
				<br>
				Now let's talk about the game itself: Guild Wars (also known as Guild Wars: Prophecies) places the player in the position of a hero who is guiding his people through the Kryta universe in search of a new home because their old lair (Ascalon) was totally dominated by a race called Charr.<br>
				<br>
				Walking through Ascalon, Shilverpeaks Mountains, Lions Arch among other areas (so far unknown to me, after all like I said, I've never been able to finish the game), we find ourselves fighting Charrs, dwarves, gargoyles, minotaurs, centaurs, undead and anything else that thing you can imagine.<br>
				<br>
				As for the gameplay and evolution of the character, the known "classes" are called here professions, and it is possible for the player to choose up to two professions (primary and secondary) that provides unique mechanics and abilities. The basic professions are presented in table 2.<br>

				What to expect from the Guild Wars streams series? The answer to this question is quite simple. Although I have 3 characters already created, my intention here, as in all gameplay presented on my channel, is to give you a gameplay with the historical content of the game. This then entails the following actions:
				<ul style="margin-left: 0.5em">
					<li>Character creation</li>
					<li>Fishinsh the main campaign with this character</li>
					<li>If possible, move it to the next campaign (expansion)</li>
					<li>If it's not possible to process with the main character to the next expansion, and play with it until the point of limit to it</li>
					<li>Keep this course until we reach Guild Wars 2, which will then give start to a new series of gameplays.</li>
				</ul>
				In addition, we can count on many deaths, attempts to continue with the missions, and the real noobish gameplay ever for this game!<br>
				<br>
				The decisions about which professions will be chosen will be taken during streaming sessions as well as more solid details about the story will be told and discovered during the gameplays.
