            Hello everyone!<br>
            First of all, I really hope that you all had a great Christmas Celebration, enjoying this date with your relatives and family.
            I have to say here that my Christmas Celebration was basically just lots of work for me because I live alone and far away from
            those who matter to me making it impossible for me to be with them on this specific date. Well, a good thing is that this hard
            work is now what I am going to share here with you!<br>
            As you know (and if you don't know yet), I have been working for a while in some scripting codes for personal and public use. So
            users of <a href="https://streamlabs.com/chatbot" target="_blank">Streamlabs Chatbot</a> (standalone version) have now a great
            opportunity to get some extra resources that I provide here and on my
            <a href="http://rebrand.ly/vonDiscord" target="_blank">Discord Server</a>, on the channel <em>#script_resources</em>. I have to
            say that most of those scripts that I am coding are mainly thinking on new streamers, people like me, as a try to make their life
            easier, based on the "issues" (I would say) that I encounter as a new streamer. It's then thinking like this that I come here with
            this update, providing some changes to my career as a streamer.<br>
            In advance, I have to say I am sorry for making this big note, but what I am posting here needs to be detailed as much as possible
            causing it to make the note really extensive.
        </h4>
        <div class="ui divider"></div>
        <h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">Schedule Changes about to come</h1><br>
        <h4>
            Starting (probably) on Jan 5, 2020, I will reduce the number of weekly streams I will be doing on Twitch (but stream sessions will be
            a bit longer than usual), so I can have more time to work on projects to improve stream quality, code more scripts and launch some side
            projects that I really need to put (back) in action, as a way to have more chance to interact with my community. I won't give spoilers
            with many details about those side projects, but in the last month note, I already mentioned about goals I want to achieve this year and
            some of those side projects are related to those goals.<br>
            So, in the fisrt weeks (or should I say months) of next year streaming schedule MIGHT be a bit odd, because I will be running some tests,
            collecting data and reports in order to:
            <ul>
                <li>Select the best days and hours for streaming</li>
                <li>Get used to the new schedule after the selection above is done</li>
                <li>Get used to the new "off-stream" work schedule (by "off-stream", please read that as all the background work that I, as a streamer,
                    do when not streaming, eg.: coding, updating website, changing alerts, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            Fact is: I have trying to gather as much information as possible lately on how to improve my streaming quality, to make this a place
            for people come to watch, have fun, make new friends and enjoy themselves especially after a long day at work or after a stressful week
            of work. My streams were AWAYS opened for people to talk about their problems and they will remain like that.<br>
            Needless to say, I will still keep playing games during my streams, taking the same plans as posted on previous notes. Although on my
            plans I will do my best to take at least the initial 30 minutes of my stream to just chat with my community about anything. That means
            the initial 30 minutes I will be talking about a specific topic with my viewers as I see fit.<br>
            Also I need to make it clear here: on our last month's note, I announced some changes to the schedule for the summer, taking the suddenly
            and constant weather changes here in the place I live. Those changes mentioned ARE STILL under consideration, as a way to preserve my equipment
            and health. By this, what I mean is:
            <ul>
                <li>IF weather changes suddenly in the middle of a stream session I will need to end it prematurely</li>
                <li>IF the weather changes bring strong rainstorms before a scheduled stream session, there won't be any stream sessions that day</li>
                <li>IF IRL/mental health status doesn't cooperate, there won't be any stream sessions</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="ui divider"></div>
        <h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">Currency changes, sound effects, and other stream changes</h1><br>
        <h4>
            For a long time, I called myself a "noob player" and started making from this my brand. I always saw myself as the noob player who plays for fun,
            with a community (guild) formed by other noob players. The time has come to change this "image". Although I am not a professional player of any game,
            although I am not capable talk about anything specific related to games like professional gamers do, I have to recognize that I'm not noob and that
            my community is not formed by noob players/viewers.<br>
            Initially, using the term "noob" to describe me was a way to "make fun" of me, making this community a fun place. But it seems that people really didn't
            understand the (black) humor implicit here. That's why I'm working on a new design for my brand. That's why today I'm thinking of a way to change all the
            previous things I've done in last years.<br>
            Some of the changes that I am working and will be (slowly) applied to my streams are described below:
            <ol>
                <li>Bot commands and interactivity:</li>
                At the moment, the bot has an automatic welcome message sent to ALL viewers visiting my stream. The message is sent to their whisper, (if the viewers
                don't have whispering blocked) and that's how I wish everyone a warm welcome if they don't want to join the chat, plus gifting them with a small amount
                of channel currency!<br>
                Other than that, the bot has a few set of commands which are (for the moment) being rewritten to provide the most interactivity between my
                viewers, me and other members in the channel. For a list of the current commands and details on how they work, I have created a small
                <a href="http://rebrand.ly/vonBotCommands" target="_blank">documentation</a> about it.
                <li>VIP Status/Badges:</li>
                VIP badges are a way for me to recognize that a specific viewer is important to me, not only as a (regular) viewer but also as a friend, a real
                supporter of my channel, since the begin of it. Due to the limit of badges I can "provide", the VIP status/badge will be given to real close
                friends of mine. There are no specific stream rewards for being a VIP, aside from getting double currency coins for visiting my streams and the
                renown status of TRUE FRIEND.
                <li>Sub Rewards:</li>
                Thinking on a great way to give subs some rewards, I want to give them a chance to get a unique "call" when they visit my stream for the first time
                during a stream session. So starting on Jan 5, 2020, subscribers to the channel will be rewarded as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li> Basic Rewards: </li>
                    Basic subscription rewards are available to all subcribers as well as channel emotes (depending on subscription tier), extra chances to
                    win raffles/giveaways, access to an exclusive channel in my stream, some "subscribers only" chat commands (under development).
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tier 1 Subscription: this will unlock all current tier 1 emotes, plus basic subscriber benefits, and give subscriber access to a custom
                            "call" for when they join the stream and send any message (custom call in effect ONLY during the subscription period)</li>
                        <li>Tier 2 Subscription: this will unlock tier 1 and tier 2 emotes and the subscriber will have a chance to be a moderator of my channel for
                            5(five) days, if they wish</li>
                        <li>Tier 3 Subscription: this will unlock all of the above benefits, in addition to tier 3 emotes. Also the subscriber will have the opportunity
                            to join me in a chat session with me via voice on my Discord server</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Twitch Prime Subscriptions: I recognize the importance of Twitch Prime Subscription, which is why Twitch Prime subscribers will have access to
                        the same benefits as a any other subscriber</li>
                    <li>Gifted Subscriptions: viewers who have received a gifted subscription will have ONLY access to the basic subscriber benefits conferred on other
                        subscribers, depending on the tier of subscription they received</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="ui inverted segment">
				    <h4 class="ui horizontal inverted divider">Note about the moderator status given to subscribers:</h4>
                    I am aware of the risks of giving moderator status for "random" people even IF for a single day. Also, I know that not everyone would like being
                    a moderator from any channel, even if for a single day. With this under consideration, IF the subscriber wants to make use of the 5-day moderator
                    benefit, there will be a small interview just to make sure that's what the subscriber really want and to make sure he is capable of doing what's
                    necessary without causing any trouble to other viewers/community members
			    </div>
                <li>Twitch Channel points:</li>
                Currently, Twitch has implemented a built-in channel currency for all affiliate and partner streamers to the platform. In my case, I haven't done any
                customization to this function, so keep collecting your channel points for future use when this new feature is customized for my channel.
                <li>"Channel Currency" Changes:</li>
                Channel currency is an extension I use on my chatbot, linked to StreamLabs. For a while, the currency system of my channel was called vsCoins. To reflect
                the changes I am working on my streams/channel, the currency will get a new name (yet to be decided). Still, the basic coins reward follows as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Watching stream: 5 coins per minute watched</li>
                    <li>Visit Stream: 25 coins for Your First Visit of the Day (50 coins if you are a VIP or Subscriber)</li>
                    <li>Follow channel: 25 coins for a "single" follow</li>
                    <li>Stream Host: 50 coins for single Host during each stream session</li>
                    <li>Cheers/bits: 250 coins for every 100 bits</li>
                    <li>Become a subscriber: 300 coins</li>
                    <li>Gifiting a subscription: 300 coins for each given gift subscription</li>
                    <li>Currency reset: currency reset will occur every 3 months</li>
                </ul>
                Ranks are given to viewers by the number of coins owned and will be renamed to reflect all planned changes, but
                let's assuming "Rank" as an example, this is how the channel viewer ranking system will work:
                <ul>
                    <li> Rank 1: 0 coins </li>
                    <li> Rank 2: 250 coins </li>
                    <li> Rank 3: 750 coins </li>
                    <li> Rank 4: 2,250 coins </li>
                    <li> Rank 5: 6,750 coins (only subscribers can achieve this rank) </li>
                    <li> Rank 6: 20,250 coins (only subscribers can achieve this rank) </li>
                </ul>
                Also, a viewer will automatically become a "regular" viewer after 100 hours in total of my stream sessions.
                <li>Sound Effects:</li>
                Adding sound effects to be used by viewers during stream it's not an easy task. With this in mind, I will be adding them
                slowly as well I will define how they should be used and "cost to use them". 
                <li>Song Request:</li>
                Song requests will be enabled on stream, starting on Jan 5, but the selection of songs will be restricted to a
                <a href="https://rebrand.ly/vonPlaylist" target="_blank">NCS song list</a>, as a way to preserve me as a streamer keeping
                in accordance with the ToS from Twitch, to avoid VoD's from being muted due to copyright.
                <li>Alerts:</li>
                The new alerts set will come soon to my stream sessions. I am reworking on all those alerts in order to make easier for me to identify
                them as well to give a bit more of identity to my channel and brand.
                <li>Giveaways/Raffles:</li>
                Making giveaways is not an easy task. I will try to make them when possible, considering both viewers' interest in the giveaway/raffle.
                <li>Stream Special Events:</li>
                In the past few years, I made a few stream events such as "Easter Stream" (2018), "Halloween Stream" (2018 and 2019), "Charity Stream" (2018)...
                I have plans to bring back those events (IF POSSIBLE) this year as well as making some random events, just for the sake of bringing new content
                to my channel. Who knows we can at some point make a small tournament between viewers? Cool thing, no?
            </ol>

        <div class="ui divider"></div>
        <h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">Reactivating my Youtube Channel</h1><br>
        <h4>
            As mentioned before, I've been studying, digging pieces of information, taking notes and everything else I can do in order to improve my stream quality
            and bring more people to our community. With this in mind (and with all considerations made above) I will reactivate my Youtube channel, with some changes
            to it. The changes are yet being planned and I will be able to work on them JUST AFTER the new schedule is set so I can take the "off-stream" time to work
            on this channel reactivation.<br>
            I am not sure yet on what kind of content I will produce to reactivate the channel, but the plans are to make at least one video upload per week. Of course,
            because "von Schappler" is a character, I won't be doing vLogs of my IRL - there is no need for that. All previous videos already uploaded to the channel will
            remain there and I might take time to upload my "past streams" on Twitch there in a specific set of videos/playlist.<br>
            I have to be honest, though... The bigger problem I have right now is <em>sound quality</em>. If you are a regular viewer to my streams, it's really possible
            that you noticed how the audio quality of my microphone went down. There is a solid explanation for that and a reason for WHY this can't be fixed so soon: I used
            to stream with a good headset. This headset was broken and the only replacement I could afford was a cheap model with really bad sound quality. The headset I own
            now is so bad that I have to enforce filters to remove hissing from it and with those filters I end also muffling my voice and I am sorry (currently) there is no
            way to just remove the hissing without muffling my voice. I am hoping to get a new and better headset as soon as possible and when that happens, for sure I know
            that I will be making part of the improvements that I want/need.<br>
            I really will take the next few weeks to make tests and mess with settings over here to see how I can improve audio quality until I can get a better microphone/headset
            but so far that is (sadly) all I can offer by now.
