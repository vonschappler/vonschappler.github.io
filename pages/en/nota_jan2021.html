        <h4>
            Hello everyone!<br>
            Before we begin with what really matters, I would like to wish all of you a (belated) Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. Needless to say
            that 2020 was not what I was hoping for and with the COVID-19 crisis, everything went from BAD to WORSE. So, with this note and the belated 
            wish of a happy 2021 I also need to say that I hope EVERYONE is taking the propper care to avoid being affected by this crisis (no more of course
            than we already expect to affected) which still persists and (I have to admit, ignored by many, like this was nothing really serious).

        <h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">Talking a little about why I am so absent from streams</h1><br>
        <h4>
            If I can recall, my last stream session was made in Aug/2020. I can't remember the specific day, but I can tell I had to end it prematurely,
            due to the (still persistent) issues with my PC build. I don't need to, but I will (just as I have mentioned plenty of times on previous notes)
            repeat that my PC build is relatively old - if we can say that. Let's just remember this PC was put together about 10 years ago (maybe a bit more
            or a bit less, but let's keep with 10 years in mind since this is the closest reference I can make to when it was put together).<br>
            Too many good and bad things happened since I stopped doing streams. I have to say there were more bad things than good
            ones, being HONEST. Before we get to this point though, I need to express my gratitude for the support this community has given to me for
            the time being. I recognize this is a small community, but it's formed by individuals who really care about me and are capable of accepting me as I
            am (at least this is how I see things, considering the fact you are still here).<br>
            Now, it's time to talk about the things that happened to me after I moved away from streaming. There is no way to tell "Let's begin talking about the
            good things or talking about the bad things" since the chronological sequence of these things ended in a mix of bad and good things at the same time.
            I think it's better to talk about them in the order they happened:
            <ul>
                <li>My last stream session in Aug/2020:</li>
                During this stream session, I started to notice much more "instability" and numerous transmission errors, which forced me to end the session before
                planned. Even though, I managed to end my stream as usual, but worried it would not be possible to complete my "ending stream ritual".
                <li>I tried to make changes on my stream schedule, doing the stream sessions on my <a href="http://rebrand.ly/vonDiscord" target="_blank">Discord server</a>:</li>
                This idea came to mind after some already planned changes to the schedule and I got to the conclusion those stream sessions would be something doable
                under my technical issues. For those sessions I was basically streaming games I was not progressing on my Twitch streams, in order to don't break any
                "Twitch stream game" progression. This alternative worked for some time. Community on the server was effectively active and in a stage of slowly growing.
                As a response to this, I had to restructure my server, by creating new channels, new roles, and some game-specific sections for those with a common interest
                to be able to reach each other. Well, all this work ended being in vain, since fewer people dropped by the stream channel each session or when they dropped by,
                it was to simply chat, not even showing interest in what was being streamed. This caused extreme frustration and I ended not making any more sessions on my
                server.
                <li>I got PC parts to make a new PC:</li>
                A community member was good enough with me to send to my house some new PC parts making it possible for me to go back to streaming as I was before Aug/2020.
                Here follow a list of the parts sent to me (I won't detail any spec) - I hope I am not forgetting to list anything, once I don't have access to the order at
                this specific moment:
                <ol>
                    <li>New PC case</li>
                    <li>Motherboard</li>
                    <li>CPU</li>
                    <li>GPU</li>
                    <li>RAM memory</li>
                    <li>Power supply</li>
                    <li>Gamer set - formed by a mouse, keyboard and headset</li>
                </ol>
                There was a problem here with all that: my happiness was converted to frustration really quickly. In technical terms, what was sent would not support the
                whole work flux that I would impose on the rig, considering these parts were a way to replace my personal computer and not only making a streaming computer
                (I have to say that even for a streaming computer this rig would not work well). It was not what happened. I ended putting everything together to test how
                it would work, but when I noticed it would not hold my work flux for both personal and professional use, I had to dismantle it and store the pieces on their
                boxes, while I wait for the right moment (and financial condition) to replace what needs to be replaced (in my opinion) to turn the new PC into a real work
                station, making it last as much as poss√≠ble.
                <li>Mental health status:</li>
                I am in an inert state. Even though I try to hide this, I know that those who know me well can tell something is not right with me just by my voice tune.
                It turns it's impossible to hide something like that from everyone for a long time. Constantly depressive, being sad most of the time, being annoyed by
                things that normally would not annoy me, frustrated. My emotional status is totally broken. As a consequence, I started to compulsively consume much more
                than usual. Food, cigarettes, coffee - even buying stuff I didn't need or would not use (and won't)... everything that can come to your mind in this matter.
                I guess there is no need to add anything to that - it's possible to guess what comes next.
                Anyways, it got to the point I saw myself refusing all small and quick job opportunities like the ones I usually do for the simple reason I didn't want to
                see or talk with anyone.
                <li>"There is more":</li>
                Here I want to talk specifically about spent money on games. Even though I can't stream due to tech issues, my PC still allows me to play games. And that
                was the main way used to get free of this (psychological) tension which I was (and still am) submitted. Why tension? Well, I don't have my own place. This
                is a rented apartment. My bills are paid with some financial help I get from my father, once he acknowledges my psychological state of mind and knows how
                hard it's to get a "real job" under my conditions. Unable to have a steady payment fund, streaming was wherefrom I could get some extra income, thanks to
                donations, subscriptions, and bits. Returning to the money spent on games, any time I saw a game under sale on those "virtual stores", I just bought them
                mindlessly. Especially if the game in question was already part of my wishlist. I have to say, that I also got some games as gifts from community members,
                but this is not the problem, everyone does what they want with their money. The problem is "and when you don't have that money?" - and I am in this case.
                I mean, to get away from my psychological tension, I jumped into a financial tension: "How to pay the credit card bills now (the one I used to buy those games)?"
            </ul>
            So, in short, I, a bankrupt person just found out myself in a worse situation than the one I was already.

        <div class="ui divider"></div>
        <h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">Stream changes and plans which were never set<br>in motion and returning to streams</h1><br>
        <h4>
            Streams have turned into something unwelcome (and still remains) after all the things I mentioned. I dare to say that when/if to it, by visiting Twitch channels
            I was used to visiting, it's possible people there would not even remember me. (I already feel like that - no one even tries to check up on me or show any small
            consideration/worry about me.) The fewer times I managed to drop by any of those channels in the meantime, I felt ignored, unnoticed - a reason which made me to
            turn away from streams even more (at least for the moment).<br>
            The few ones which still have any consideration, get stuck on the cold and sporadic "hello" (or look for me when they need me for something). I am not really the
            kind of person who tries looking for the others - and when it happens, it's because THAT person REALLY matters to me. Well, and what all this have to do with
            streaming? In short and after everything mentioned above, I lost the will to keep working with anything related to streams. Following this line, I just gave up on
            being active on stream channels I was used to visit, even if it was just for lurking purposes. Even though I keep saying and showing how thankful I am for the
            support I get from this community, I have to admit it's not enough to fill any emptiness and/or provide any stimulus to continue. This means I don't have clues of
            when the stream changes plans will be set in motion or if they will. So, everything on this matter is set under standby for some more time.<br>
            Still, following this line of thought, there is no expectation for me to return to streams, might it be for technical reasons or health reasons. Part of me seems
            to be dying each day (that if it's not already dead) and I really guess it's the will to keep trying to work with something that ALMOST NEVER grants me any success.
            Everything can change, so, I won't say "I not doing streams anymore". I'll say only that my return will happen when things allow me to. If they don't allow anymore,
            no more streams whatsoever - this simple. It's sad to admit it, but I have to see things like this to avoid post frustrations. I know that is a big risk, I may be
            already losing or will lose many things, but there is nothing to do about it (I already lost too much, anyway). So for me, what I can do is to sit and wait the things
            get back to normal.<br>
            There is no reason to talk about "new plans" here - or even mention the old plans I had in mind. The reason for it it's not having expectations about anything. There is
            no reason to talk about it when there is no flame in here and I am hopeless about anything capable to feed the "streaming" flame back again. So, things will happen when
            they have to. Period.

        <h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">Other projects</h1><br>
        <h4>
            I had the total conviction I would be able to set motion to some projects in mind during 2020. Needless to say it, but I failed (again, as always) in executing any
            project. Right now I am being tormented by a lack of inspiration and creativity state of mind, which is uncertain when it will stop tormenting me. I spent so much
            time studying, trying to come with new ideas, reading - in search of the different, something capable of bringing enough attention from the other to turn something
            small into something big, big enough that it would sow seeds to grow into fruits. All the time dedicated to it was in vain. Everything I could think about it already
            existed around there (sometimes even better than what I had in mind originally). It makes me feel in distress to live with this emotional and rational inertia, seeing
            myself stuck in the same place and unable to read the big letters of a billboard even if they are drawn right in front of me.<br>
            It hurts a lot to acknowledge everything I suggest anyone works for them, but not for me, a person who works mostly by myself while trying to make this a safe and healthy
            community. Why not say self-sustainable and rentable (remember streaming is also a way of paid work and it was wherefrom I could get some extra income). I am REALLY not
            trying to judge anyone in here, but I see so many people with no skills, with no qualification or professionalism to keep doing this having success and I just get stuck
            hitting my head on the wall, only hurting me even more with the lack of success.<br>
            There are no projects for this year, exactly for the single fact, none of last year's projects got out their blueprints. It's better to not make any plans, to don't bring
            false expectations for me or anyone else over something that once more will fail.

        <h4>
            Considering everything said above, I would NOT consider this note as a farewell, but a see you soon (or should I say "See you when things allow me to come back"?),
            wishing to every single individual who reads this everything I don't have in my life: success, prosperity, and happiness. That's it. I leave here a small note: 
            direct messages on my social media (<a href="http://rebrand.ly/vonDiscord" target="_blank">Discord</a> and <a href="http://rebrand.ly/vonTwitter" target="_blank">Twitter</a>)
            will always be opened for those who want to talk with and/or to me. Also, even with everything that's happening I am trying to keep some reasonable activity on my
            discord server, chatting with those who wish to.<br>
            Ah! I promise to TRY to update this website when possible, preferentially when things change for the best.
