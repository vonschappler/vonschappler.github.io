				What makes this game so special for me? Well, let's begin with saying this game took elements from two games I really enjoy playing:
				<code>Destiny 2</code> and <code>Tom Clancy's: The Division Series</code>. Fluid gameplay; cool skill animations; gore; and fast-paced
				action shooter; are the things which really got my attention. ESPECIALLY the gore part - oh boy, how I miss gore in games like this!<br><br>
				Needless to say, this one is a "loot-and-shoot" game, and if all the promises done by the devs are real, this game will become
				what <code>Anthem</code> would be (remember when Bioware announced Anthem as a revolutionary title, full game for free, a huge amount of content
				to be played? Well, the same promises were made by People Can Fly and Square Enix).<br><br>
				Well, at least I can say after playing the FREE (this is the most important part - IT'S FREE)
				<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/680420/OUTRIDERS/" target="_blank">playable demo</a> of this game, that I enjoyed playing it.
				This demo gives a chance for us to experience the prologue and the first chapter of the game, as well as leveling up to 6 characters to the
				cap level of 7 and rising up the gameplay difficulty to 5 (which in the game is called as World Tier).<br><br>
				Although the game was released today, I still haven't a chance to play the final released version. So I am writing this review based on what I could
				experience by playing the already mentioned FREE DEMO! Time to delve a little into the game lore and talk about the few features this demo
				had to offer.<br><br>
				In <code>Outriders</code> (as the title already suggests) the player controls a character, (which I would say is) the LAST LIVING Outrider, by
				exploring the savage lands of Enoch - an "Earth-like" planet, which would be used for colonization by humans. How did you get there?
				Well, to avoid spoilers, I will restrict this answer to the fewest words possible: Earth was destroyed, spaceships were sent to explore other
				planets - so humans could have a new planet to live, bad things happened after your ship landed on Enoch, and well, from your outriders' team, you end
				being the last one alive. From this point beyond, anything else I say would end as a spoiler and/or speculation and I will do my best to avoid this.
				But - this we must agree: what a way of starting the lore of a Sci-Fi "loot-and-shoot" game, no?<br><br>
				From other reviews and news I could find out there, it's said the game will have enough content to provide AT LEAST 30 to 40 hours of gameplay,
				if the player follows only the main questline. The game offers not only this but also side missions which will increase these hours a bit, and my hope
				is that it will feature something like "Dungeon Missions", as most games do, so we can go deeper into the game to experience even more challenging enemy
				encounters.<br><br>
				Outriders is an instanced game, most likely <code>Tom Clancy's: The Division Series</code>. Players, after creating their characters, are sent to a "lobby",
				where they can team up with friends and experience the multiplayer version of the game. Players can also set options to their lobby, by setting it as private -
				if they want to play alone; friends only - if they wish to allow only their friends to join the game session at any time; or open - allowing anyone to
				join them.<br><br>
				To make everything better, the game allows the players to select ONE of the possible four classes the game offer - each class with their unique skillset
				and "role" in the game. Those classes are shot-detailed in the <code>Table 1</code>.<br>

				These are some of the features this game has to offer:
				<ul>
					<li>Craft System:</li>
					Although during the demo gameplay, craft stations were not accessible, it's possible to craft/empower/change equipment using this system.
					<li>Possibility to replay portions of the main questline and side missions:</li>
					The game allows the players to "rollback" their main questline to any point they wish and replay it. This feature is a really great addition
					to games of this genre, because this allows players to join newcomers and help them, as well as allowing players to collect specific items which are
					accessible only in specific parts/zones of the game which are playable in certain history missions.
					<li>Skill-tree customization:</li>
					The game offers to players a total of 8 skills to be unlocked, which of them, only 3 are useable at the same time. Those usable skills can be changes whenever
					the player wants. Also, each class has a set of three branches of skills to evolve (at will). Those branches will either confer a bonus to weapon attacks,
					survivability or ability boost.
					<li>Accolades to be attained during your "day-by-day" gameplay:</li>
					Unlike most games, those accolades/achievements are attained simply by playing the game! There are more than 400 different accolades and some of them
					have multiple stages, meaning that - if the player is a completionist, they will have plenty of things to work in the game!
					<li>Dense lore:</li>
					The lore of the game is not only discovered by playing the main questline, but also by playing all kinds of missions, collecting items, killing enemies
					(this will give progress to the bestiary) and by meeting new NPCs through the game!
					<li>Control of game difficulty:</li>
					As the player progress in the game, they will unlock new a difficulty level (and, with this new level, rewards to help they on the new world difficulty).
					This system is called "World Tier" and it's possible to unlock up to fifteen levels of difficulty. They are by default always set to the hardest level possible,
					but players can adjust those levels to something lower if the challenge is "too big".
					<li>Loots are exclusive to your character class:</li>
					Until the moment I am writing this, I haven't found anything I could not use on my current character as "loot". Mission rewards as well were items usable
					specifically by the class I was playing. Higher quality items have passive boosts that confer synergy to the player character class abilities, improving them
					in various ways - from ability damage increase to a number of consecutive uses before the skill enters in cooldown. This allows the player to start focusing on the
					so-called "end-game skillset" right at the beginning of the game, instead of forcing the players to play through the whole game and just then, start looking
					for something specific tom make this build.
				</ul>
				For those who never played "Destiny 2" and/or "Tom Clancy's: The Division Series" games, below there is a table displaying all the similarities between both games.<br>

				Based on posts made in social media channels by the game devs, the game won't feature any kind of "money paywall" for unlockable features such as: DLCs, season, and/or new
				content. I hope they stick to this and keep the continued support to the game, always improving it and offering new things for players to do, FOR FREE. I really see this
				game as the "rising phoenix" to the genre, based on everything I have read about it, based on my experience during the demo playthrough and this is why this game is now the
				main feature on my <a href="http://rebrand.ly/vonYouTube" target="_blank">YouTube Channel</a>.<br><br>
