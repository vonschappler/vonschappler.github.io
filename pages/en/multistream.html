			This script was initially developed to help me (as a streamer) to manage my Multi-Streaming sessions easily. For months I
			crossed around streamers making Multi-Streaming sessions and mostly having to add this feature as a stand-alone command to
			their bots, "forcing" them to edit the command (or create a new one) every time they wanted to use with different friends.
			So, thinking on those streamers (and, of course, on me) I came with this script for the StreamLabs stand-alone chatbot.<br>
			I still don't know IF I will work on a version for the same script for the in-built StreamLabs: OBS bot, but for the moment,
			considering the ability to develop things for this stand-alone bot, I will keep only with this version.<br>
			It is needless to say, but I will make this note here: if you don't have the stand-alone version of the bot, you can download
			it from their page <a href="https://streamlabs.com/chatbot" target="_blank">here</a>. It's also important to note that (so far)
			the Multi-Streaming hosts resources available here are for Twitch only.<br><br>
			Below I will describe some of the features this script actually provides:
			<ul>
				<li>Easy commands configuration</li>
				<li>Auto-message with Multi-Stream host link, defined by a timer</li>
				<li>Game settings within the script settings or via command</li>
				<li>Log file output with the script usage during a specifc stream session</li>
			</ul>
			It's now time to take a deep look at this script.
			<div class="ui inverted segment">
				<h4 class="ui horizontal inverted divider">IMPORTANT:</h4>
				A) Any changes made to the information provided in the script UI will take effect only after <code>"Save Settings"</code>
				button is pressed. To ensure the changes were saved, it's advised to press it two times and always reload the script after
				saving settings.<br>
      			B) Keep in mind that changes made using commands in chat won't be cased on the script UI as new settings to the script.<br>
				C) All examples given here are based on default values for fields in the script UI.<br>
				D) It's important that caster, editors, and moderators of the channel that will use this script have the caster's bot account
				added to their friends' list, because this script will send most of the answers of commands to their whisper, in case those
				mentioned have their whisper set to don't receive whispers from non-friends.

			This group is responsible for the general settings from the script which will be controlled by the commands (listed and detailed
			later in this document). Messages, Multi-Stream "host", game and casters you are Multi-Streaming with can be set here. Below,
			there are details on each field of this group:<br><br>
			<code>a.1) Message to send on chat:</code><br>
			This field is used to define the message the bot will display in chat whenever the specific command to display the link is used or by the
			auto-message send by the script. Those are the required parameters for this field:
			<ul>
				<li><code>{caster}</code>: this will be replaced by the caster name</li>
				<li><code>{friends}</code>: this will be replaced by the friends the streamer is streaming with</li>
				<li><code>{link}</code>: this will be replaced by the  Multi-Streaming url created by the script</li>
				<li><code>{game}</code>: this will be replaced by the game being played with <code>{friends}</code></li>
			</ul>
			<div class="ui raised segment">
				Example of working message:<br>
				<code>
					{caster} is playing {game} with {friends} Go check them playing together at {link} !
				</code>
				<div class="ui inverted segment">
					<div class="ui inverted horizontal divider">IMPORTANT:</div>
					It's STRONGLY ADVISED to add a blank space after <code>{link}</code> to avoid a broken link creation.
				</div>
			</div>
			<code>a.2) Friends you are streaming with:</code><br>
			This field will hold the list of casters the script needs to process in order to create the Multi-Stream URL. It's important to note
			a few things about this:
			<ul>
				<li>The script will automatically create a link (although it won't enable displaying it on chat) automatically if this field is
					not empty.</li>
				<li>If the this field is empty, you need to give a list of casters/friends using the specific command (to be detailed later in
					this documentation.)</li>
				<li>Names inside this field must be separated by a blank space as shown below:</li>
				<code>caster1 caster2 caster3</code>
			</ul>
			<code>a.3) Site for Multi-Streaming:</code><br>
			This is a dropdown field where the user can select his favorite Multi-Streaming "host". It's important to notice the <code>( id = x )</code>
			(where x is a number) next to the name of the selected "host". This id value (number) can be used to change/update the link using a specific
			command (which will be explained later in this document).<br><br>
			<code>a.4) Game to play with friends:</code><br>
			This field is used to set up the game which is going to be played during the Multi-Stream session. The field also can be left blank 
			or be filled with
			<code>auto</code>. By leaving it blank or filling it with <code>auto</code> will make the script to get the game played from the
			caster's Twitch dashboard.
			It's also possible to change the game via command, as it will be explained later.

			The user can customize the commands used in chat by this script in this group. This group is composed of:<br><br>
			<code>b.1) Command to set/enable Multi-Stream link:</code><br>
			This command will both set the Multi-Stream link defined with the settings defined on <code>a</code> and start the counter
			for the auto-message display (in case the auto-display message feature is enabled). The user can change it to anything they
			like and it's important to note here that THIS command can be used ONLY by the caster, editors, and moderators of the channel.<br><br>
			<code>b.2) Command to reset the Multi-Stream link:</code><br>
			This command works in a similar way to the previous one, but its main function is to disable the Multi-Stream link, turning off
			the auto-display in chat (considering the auto-display feature is enabled). THIS command can be used ONLY by the caster, editors,
			and moderators of the channel.<br><br>
			<code>b.3) Command to set game manually:</code><br>
			This command allows the user the possibility of updating the game to be displayed in the message sent on chat when the Multi-Stream link
			is displayed. THIS command can be used ONLY by the caster, editors, and moderators of the channel.<br><br>
			<code>b.4) Command to set site manually:</code><br>
			This command is used to update the Multi-Stream link displayed, changing the Multi-Stream "host". THIS command can be used ONLY by the
			caster, editors, and moderators of the channel.<br><br>
			<code>b.5) Command to send Multi-Stream link on chat:</code><br>
			This is the command used by everyone in the channel in order to display the Multi-Stream link created by this script in chat.<br><br>
			<code>b.6) User cooldown (in minutes):</code><br>
			This slider is to set user's cooldown of the command defined in <code>b.5</code> to avoid spamming the link in chat. The minimum cooldown
			allowed is 1 minute while the maximum allowed by this is 15 minutes.
			<div class="ui inverted segment">
				NOTES:<br>
				a. Casters, editors, and moderators won't be affected by the user cooldown defined on <code>b.6</code>.<br>
				b. To refrain the permission levels above from "quick" spamming the link it was added a small cooldown of 10 seconds.
			</div>
			<div class="ui raised segment">
				<div class="ui horizontal divider">Script commands in action:</div>
				<ul>
					<li>Setting and/or enabling Multi-Stream link:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Using values saved on script UI (item a.2):</li>
						<code>!setmultion</code>
						<li>Using custom values or updating a previously created link:</li>
						<code>!setmultion &lt;casters&gt;</code><br>
						(&lt;casters&gt; is a list of casters to be displayed, separated by a blank space)<br>
					</ul>
					ANSWER:<br>
            		The answer for this command will depend on the success or fail of Multi-Stream link creation and it will be sent on the user's whisper.<br><br>
					<li>Disabling Multi-Stream link:</li>
					<code>!setmultioff</code><br>
					ANSWER:<br>
					The bot will send a whisper to the user to inform the Multi-Stream link was disabled.<br><br>
					<li>Updating the game to be displayed in the Multi-Stream chat message:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Retrieving game name from Twitch's caster dashboard:</li>
						<code>!setmultigame</code> or <code>!setmultigame auto</code><br>
						(<code>auto</code> MUST be written with no capital letters in order for this to work)
						<li>Using a new/custom game name:</li>
						<code>!setmultigame &lt;game&gt;</code><br>
						(everything written after the command will be defined as &lt;game&gt;, so the user don't need to worry about games with "big" names)
					</ul>
					ANSWER:<br>
					The answer for this command will be sent to the user whisper and it will depend on the user's input for this command.<br><br>
					<li>Updating the Multi-Stream "host":</li>
					<code>!setmultisite &lt;id&gt;</code><br>
					(&lt;id&gt;, as already mentioned in <code>a.3</code>, is the number reference to the Multi-Stream site to be used, displayed in
					the dropdown selector on the script UI)<br>
					ANSWER:<br>
					The answer depends on the <code>id</code> entered. A success or failure message will be sent to the command user's whisper.<br><br>
					<li>Displaying the Multi-Stream link created in chat:</li>
					<code>!multi</code><br>
					ANSWER:<br>
					The answer depends on the Multi-Stream link created. The script also has a default message to be displayed in case no link was set up,
					due to a syntax error on using any of the commands above or because the command to disable the link was used. If the user of the command
					is under <code>User Cooldown</code> or the command itself is under cooldown, a whisper is sent to the user informing the command is on
					cooldown and how many minutes until it can be used again.

			<code>c.1) Allow to send auto Multi-Stream link?</code><br>
			This is a built-in timer function for this script. With this, the caster can allow (or not) the script to send the
			Multi-Stream link on chat automatically, using a defined cooldown for this "timer", without having to worry in creating
			a specific timer for displaying the created link.<br><br>

			This slider is to define the time delay between auto message posts by the timer. The delay goes from 0 to 60 minutes.

			This is another self-explanatory group. These settings are here to manage the script usage LogFiles of when/how

			any bug on the script, these LogFile settings are here for that purpose.<br><br>
			<code>d.1) Display Script log in the ChatBot?</code><br>
			By default, this feature is disabled, and as it says it will display the usage log "live" within the ChatBot log section ("Scripts&gt;Logs").<br><br>
			<code>d.2) AutoSave ScriptLog file?</code><br>
			By default, this feature is enabled. This will ensure that a log file is saved under the <code>Log</code> directory
			created by the script when:
			<ul>
				<li>the bot is closed</li>
				<li>the script is reloaded within the bot or</li> 
				<li>the script is disabled within the bot</li>
