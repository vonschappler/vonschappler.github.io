				Think of someone who knows NOTHING, aboslutely NOTHING about the universe of Dungeons and Dragons? Well, the noob here is that someone! Not to say I do not know anything, I remember the animated series on television.<br>
				<br>
				Okay, to say that I do not know anything at all, is to be a little silly. I know D&D is a classic tabletop RPG game, as well as other RPGs that exist in the same style. I also know that there are several games for various consoles, based on one of several "plans of existence/worlds" or "realms" (for a complete list of realms, see Table 1 - whose information was obtained from articles on the web). In addition to these games, which include the titles of the series "Baldur's Gate" and "Neverwinter Nights" and the animated series I have already mentioned, the D&D universe has 5 films and several products related to tabletop RPG.<br>
				<br>
				So far, my contact with the series was very restricted: I had the opportunity to play "Baldur's Gate" on Playstation 2, Neverwinter Nights (PC) and Neverwtiner (the MMORPG developed by Cryptic Studios and published by Perfect World Entertainment).<br>

				For this reason, I decided to bring a game since it seems unknown, or at least, I see not many discussions about it. The Dungeons and Dragons Online, developed by Turbine. My contact with this game is practically none. I know practically nothing about the game and for the little contact I had to record the preview videos and other materials for the channel and for this website, I could see three things at once:<br>
				<br>
				1. The game has a very different gameplay from what I imagined (it is a mix of all the games I've had contact until now)<br>
				2. It has several zones to be explored, with zones being instantiated (for the player or group) and its visual contact with other players occurs only within large cities, despite the ability to talk to them via global chat even if you are inside an instanced zone<br>
				3. The story is told by a narrator who "gives you tips" on what to do within certain areas. For example, if you (or your group) are close to some "hidden" item the narrator's voice announces something like: "You feel a gentle breeze entering the room next to a solid wall, a great indication that there is a way out of this dungeon."<br>

				I have to admit I did not expect anything like that. Another feature that is important to point out here is that within the game we have the famous "dice roll" which exists in tabletop RPGs. Everything you do is decided by a dice roll within the game and in a specific region of your screen Ã½ou can see a small dice icon, showing the result of the roll performed - although you can't find any details on how this roll was made, unlike it happens in the games of the series Neverwinter Nights series.<br>
				<br>
				Now let's talk a bit about the game itself, based on research I did before deciding to bring the game to the channel.<br>
				<br>
				What I can say initially is that the game takes place in the "universe" of Eberron and after a few years online it was added content referring to the Forgotten Realms. Well do not ask me if the game follows some chronological order - I don't know Dungeons and Dragons that much to answer that. I just know that the game went from the "Buy to play" model to the "Free to Play" model and during this transition process there was the addition of this content I just mentioned.<br>
				<br>
				The creation of the character follows the rules presented in the corebook D&D3.5, the same rules applied throughout the gameplay, with small adaptations to transform a turn-based combat to a real-time combat. The central point of the game is in the mainland Xen'drik and the central city Stormreach, which brings a vastness of missions to be completed inside and outside of Stormreach. The character's evolution system is complex and the game features several playable classes and races (some of which are unlocked by acquiring DLCs or premium player packs - well, that's how a "free to play" game works, selling "premium contents").<br>
				<br>
				The game begins with your character unconscious on the coast of Korthos Island after his ship has been attacked by a dragon. From that point on, your character begins a journey in Korthos to free the city from the Sahuagin's domain and then goes finally to Stormreach.<br>
				<br>
				The progression of the character in the game is based on missions. There is no gain of experience for killing enemies throughout the game. Experience is earned ONLY by completing successfully a mission.<br>
				<br>
				And what to expect from this series besides a lot of noobish gameplays?
				<ul style="margin-left: 0.5em">
					<li>Character creation</li>
					<li>Progress with this character until the point of limit the "free to play model" allows me to</li>
					<li>Continue with D&D gameplays, but by playing Neverwinter (Cryptic Studios)</li>
				</ul>
				In addition, we can count on many deaths, attempts to continue with the missions and whenever necessary, group games! So if you want to join this adventure, remember that this game is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/206480/Dungeons__Dragons_Online/" target="_blank">Steam</a> - and let the game being!<br><br>
