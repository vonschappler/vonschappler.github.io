				Think of someone who knows NOTHING, absolutely NOTHING about the universe of Dungeons and Dragons? Well, the noob here is that someone! Not to say I do not know anything,
				I remember the animated series I watched when I was a kid.<br><br>
				Okay, to say that I do not know anything at all, is to be a little silly. I know DnD is a classic tabletop RPG game, as well as other RPGs that exist in the same style.
				I also know that there are several games for various consoles, based on one of several "plans of existence/worlds" or "realms" (for a complete list of realms, see Table 1 - whose
				information was obtained from articles on the web). In addition to these games, which include the titles of the series "Baldur's Gate" and "Neverwinter Nights" and the animated
				series I have already mentioned, the DnD universe has 5 films and several products related to tabletop RPG.<br><br>
				Well, although I consider myself a Storyteller RPG addict, my addiction has a name: "Vampire the Masquerade", which
				takes place in the
				<a href="https://www.worldofdarkness.com/" target="_blank">World of Darkness</a> (usually mentioned elsewhere as WoD) among with other creatures like Wraiths, Mummies, Angels, Demons, Werewolves... This explains
				why I know little about the DnD (abbreviation to Dungeons and Dragons - note: it's also common to see D&D used as an abbreviation to it) world.<br><br>
				So far, my contact with the series was very restricted: I had the opportunity to play "Baldur's Gate" on Playstation 2, Neverwinter Nights (PC), and Neverwinter (the MMORPG
				developed by Cryptic Studios and published by Perfect World Entertainment).<br><br>

				For this reason, I decided to write this, since the game seems unknown, or at least, I see not many discussions about it. Dungeons and Dragons Online was developed by Turbine.
				My contact with this game is practically none. I know practically nothing about the game and for the little contact I had to record the preview videos and other materials
				for the channel and for this website, I could see three immediately important things I need to mention:<br><br>
				1. The game has different gameplay from what I imagined (it is a mix of all the games I've had contact with until now)<br>
				2. It has several zones to be explored, with zones being instantiated (for the player or group) and its visual contact with other players occurs only within large cities,
				despite the ability to talk to them via global chat even if you are inside an instanced zone<br>

				3. Some events are told by a narrator who "gives you tips" on what to do within certain areas. For example, if you (or your group members) are close to some "hidden"
				item the narrator's voice announces something like: "You feel a gentle breeze entering the room next to a solid wall, a great indication that there is a way out of this dungeon."<br><br>
				
				I have to admit I did not expect anything like that. Another feature that is important to point out here is that within the game we have the famous "dice roll" which exists
				in every tabletop/Storyteller RPGs. Yes! Everything you do is decided by a dice roll within the game and in a specific region of your screen Ã½ou can see a small dice icon,
				showing the result of the roll performed - although you can't find any details on how this roll was made, unlike it happens in the games of the series Neverwinter Nights series.
				(As far a I know, in the Neverwinter Night series, a dice roll is made based on your character sheet and following the rules from DnD core books for the tabletop versions of the game.)<br><br>
				Now let's talk a bit about the game itself, based on research I did before writing this review.<br><br>
				What I can say initially is that the game takes place in the "universe" of Eberron and after a few years the game was launched, content referring to the Forgotten Realms was added to it.
				Well do not ask me if the game follows some chronological order - I don't know DnD that much to answer that. I just know that the game went from the "buy-to-play" model to the
				free-to-play" model and during this transition process the addition of this content I just mentioned happened to the game.<br><br>
				As it seems, the character creation follows the rules presented in the core book DnD3.5, the same rules applied throughout the gameplay, with small adaptations to transform a turn-based
				combat to real-time combat. The central point of the game is in the mainland Xen'drik and the central city Stormreach, which brings a vastness of missions to be completed inside
				and outside of Stormreach. The character's evolution system is complex and the game features several playable classes and races (some of which are unlocked by acquiring DLCs or
				premium player packs - well, that's how most "free-to-play" games survive, they sell "premium contents").<br><br>
				The game begins with your character unconscious on the coast of Korthos Island after the ship it was traveling was attacked by a dragon. From that point on, your character begins
				a journey in Korthos to free the city from the Sahuagin's domain and then goes finally to Stormreach.<br><br>
				The progression of the character in the game is based on missions. There is no gain of experience for killing enemies throughout the game. Experience is earned ONLY by successfully
				completing missions given by NPCs.<br><br>

					<div class="header">And what to expect from DnD Online?</div>
					Well, considering I haven't (yet) played this game as much as I wanted before writing this review, not much I can say, except for hours and hours of gameplay if you really
					enjoy the game and want to progress to reach the "end game".<br>
