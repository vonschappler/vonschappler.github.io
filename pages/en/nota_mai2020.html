            Hello everyone! <br>
            It has passed a few months since my last update to this website. I am aware that it's not part of my plans and my compromise with
            you to remain all this time in "radio silence", but this is something I still can't control. So many changes are on undergoing
            process, a few others were already applied while so many I am not even sure they will be applied. <br>
            There are so many things sketched, with no deadline to be executed and so many more that I can't stop thinking about - work over
            work, before even concluding what's already started. (I have to admit that time management was never a strength, and now with all this
            "free time" due to the current situation we are living - the COVID-19 crisis - what was already bad, became worse). <br>
            So I come with this small note to bring up some news about little things I am slowly working at, as my mind allows me to keep working
            without external distractions.
        </h4>
        <div class="ui divider"></div>
        <h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">About the possible schedule changes</h1><br>
        <h4>
            So far I was unable to work on the tests mentioned on my previous note. That said, the old stream schedule, as displayed on various sources
            - including the one on this website, is still valid. I am already dealing with issues in keeping the current schedule as solid as possible,
            so planning changes for the moment is something that I won't be able to do. <br>
            With this COVID-19 crisis, my neighborhood is now noisier than it was before, as the kids are now "roaming" all the way around here. It seems
            their parents are not capable of keeping them at home isolated, as it should be to avoid / reduce this virus contamination, and the excessive
            external noise creates a barrier between the new schedule testing and me, as it's also responsible for frequently migraine crisis which are
            already reason enough for me to don't stick to my starting schedule. <br>
            I have high hopes that when everything goes back to normal, I would be able to work on those tests or at least keep the compromise of streaming
            on the days already scheduled.

        <h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">Stream contents</h1><br>
        <h4>
            Ok, it's time (again) to talk about this. Although I own a big library of games, having plans for my streams and
            everything else, I am now dealing with so many issues that are now making me rethink about the stream contents.
            Let's talk a bit about
            those issues:
            <ul>
                <li> Current PC rig: </li>
                The main reason this bothers me it's related to my stream quality. I value the quality of my streams, always doing the possible
                to provide the most professional content as possible, with the best quality I can offer, always using the best resolution possible,
                but things I can't control at this moment has forced me to reduce the offered quality of my contents. So, as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        It's not possible to play games using the best graphical quality anymore
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It's not possible to stream games with the resolution 1080p @ 60FPS as before. Nowadays the maximum resolution is 720p @ 30FPS
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It's not possible to play "new games" or games that require too many resources from my computer, making it drop lots of frames 
                        during stream sessions
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Internet service provider (ISP):</li>
                In order to make high-quality streams, it's imperative that I have a stable ISP. At this moment, due to the lack of
                options, I am stuck on using my actual ISP, which does not offer a good service, making connection unstable in rainy/stormy days.
                <li>Game genres:</li>
                There are so many different game genres today. What I could note is that the genres I play during my streams seems not
                to be noticed or taken with appreciation. Although I understand some of the most important aspects of a stream and have the conscience that I
                may need to "sacrifice" myself if i want to bring more friends to hang out, I wouldn't feel great or giving my all if I would be doing streams
                of game genres I dislike.
                <li>Facecam:</li>
                I noticed this is turning into an issue at this moment. People fail to understand that the stream sessions are not made by "a real person", but
                by a virtual persona, known as "von Schappler". This will remain like that, even if I understand that for some people - knowing the person behind
                the persona is necessary for them to create a link between us.
            </ul>
            So, taking those considerations and some other I decided not to expose, I've been working on some tests - which took part of my "free time" making
            changes to my <a href="http://rebrand.ly/vonDiscord" target="_blank">Discord server</a>. Changes to my stream contents will be done as well to fit the
            new model of stream I will be hosting when those tests I am doing are concluded.
        </h4>
        <div class="ui divider"></div>
        <h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">Streams sessions on my Discord Server</h1><br>
        <h4>
            I have mentioned above about some changes on my Discord server. One of those changes is the use of a new feature offered by Discord: live streams
            inside server voice channels. That said, I am hosting a few test stream sessions on my server, allowing a different level of interaction with my
            community. We can now have also not only text chat, but also voice chat while viewers are there watching my stream!<br>
            This new model of stream is undergoing some tests and after some results, I was able to notice there I am able to stream
            some games I would not be able to stream directly to Twitch. At the same time, this is a great alternative for me to bring stable streams and
            offer variety, it prevents me of providing professional/high-quality streams since the options of "customization" are limited.<br>
            I have to admit I still don't have enough knowledge about this tool, not being sure of what's possible to be done there or not, but streaming
            inside my server will be something to consider doing when I judge it's convenient/necessary.
        </h4>
        <div class="ui divider"></div>
        <h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">Twitch, YouTube, Podcast and Social Media</h1><br>
        <h4>
            On a previous note, I mentioned about plans to reenable my <a href="http://rebrand.ly/vonYouTube" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>. I am still
            looking for ideas/suggestions on what kind of content I will produce there. I want to make use of the platform to something different from what I
            already do on my streams. I started that channel uploading gameplays, then tried using it for streaming and finally decided to repost my VoDs of
            past stream sessions. Actually I am still trying to guess what I should do there for this community.<br>
            I believe that the bigger challenge here is selecting the content I will produce for it, especially for working all by myself with all this,
            having mind that everything I do takes time to be created, diverging my focus from other things to create contents to the channel, without being
            sure this is the way to go. I've asked some friends and community members on what should I do with the channel and at this moment, all suggestions
            given are still being under evaluation before I start trying any of them.<br>
            The same mentioned above is applied to my <a href="http://rebrand.ly/vonPodcast" target="_blank">Podcast</a>, (as you can see, I have already one
            set up, just waiting for the contents to be added). Some of my current time is taken to study possibilities, once I really don't want to follow the
            "more of the same" path, and then be able to offer something unique to my community. After listening to a few casts out there, I see that the
            possibilities of making something unique are a bit small to give unique content based on my current conditions.<br>
            I also need to keep in mind that other used Social Media channels are "stuck", meaning I need to start working with them. And to say the least,
            Twitch is about to launch some changes to its platform, which is going to make me direct some of my time to work on "recreating" a few things to
            reflect those changes. I can't yet evaluate the real "consequences" of these changes, since, from the preview, I have access to, the new layout is
            FAR from being friendly to VIEWERS and STREAMERS. As for us streamers, it'll be something hard to set up, due to the limited options of customization
            we have there.<br>
            When something in this subject is defined, a new note will be posted with updates.
