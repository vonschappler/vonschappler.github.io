Most of the games I play on my stream sessions are "old" (by old, I mean, games with at least 5 or more years from launch)!<br><br>With that in mind, I am working slowly to expand my game library and most of the games I play fits that main condition - they are at least 5 years old. Keep in mind that some of them I have <strong>NEVER</strong> played before!</p>

				<p>With my gameplays, aside the little rompants when dealing with "unexpected situations", what I want to achieve is to show it's possible to have fun and enjoy any game without getting into that "standard" most players want - maximum level, TOP gear and other things like! As a unique person, I enjoy pretty much playing on my UNIQUE way and I am here to show that <strong>YOU CAN DO THAT TOO</strong>!</p>

				<p>Ooooops! Yeah, I am pretty sure this might be a clich√©, but that's the truth! We have to embrace ourselves as we are, no matter if we are just starter players or professional ones! So, let's make sure we embrace our n00bselves and have lots of fun just being ourselves, by saying a "huge-big-fat NO" to all those standards which are being imposed to newcomers to the gaming community!</p>
