		<h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">Why von Schappler?</h1><br>
		<h4>
			So that's one of the questions I've heard the most. Mostly from people who know me but do not know my story with <b>RPG PnP</b> (aka RPG Storyteller).<br>
			That said, and answering in a succinct way, von Schappler is the surname of one of my RPG characters I used in <b>Vampire: the Masquerade</b> adventures, a character I really enjoyed using in this game.<br>
			The name then took its rightful place and since then I started using it to represent me in the gamer world.
		</h4>
		<div class="ui divider"></div>
		<h1 class="ui big teal right ribbon label">How long have you been in contact with games?<br>How many hours do you play per day?</h1><br>
		<h4>
			Alright, let's go! My story with games begins there in mid-1989, when I had my first contact with the famous <b>Atari 1600</b> owned by my cousin. I was really glazed with those graphics (sometimes black and white) of the game when competing with my cousin in <b>Pong</b> matches. After that, I saw those flipper machines with <b>Enduro</b>, but I only came to have my first gaming console at the end of 1989 - when I won an Atari just like the one my cousin had.<br>
			From there, I was owned a some other gaming consoles, but always being "a generation ago"... <b>Master System</b>, <b>Mega Drive</b>, <b>Nintendo </b> (the 8bits one), <b>Super Nintendo</b>, <b>Game Boy</b>, <b>Playstantion 2</b>, <b>PSP 2000</b> - all these passed through my hands. But the first PC I won was in 1996, and from there I practically left consoles aside and going to enjoy <b>PC games</b>.<br>
			I currently have a reasonable PC, which still allows me to "work" and play, in addition to a <b>XBox 360</b> and a <b>Playstation 3</b>, but I spend more time playing on my PC - where I stay about 12h daily, 6h of these playing and/or researching about games.
		</h4>
		<div class="ui divider"></div>
		<h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">When and why you decided to start streaming?</h1><br>
		<h4>
			In recent years, seeing how all things have been evolving, I realized that making content of something that I liked as a child would be the chance for me to show off the talent (or lack thereof) I have!<br>
			I started with a <b>YouTube</b> channel using my personal email - where I posted some videos. Nothing too serious. They were videos with tutorials for some things I used to setup in my characters in the game <b>Aion</b>.<br>
			That's when I realized that many people besides tutorials also made gameplay videos. But few of them focused on what I like most in a game - the story.<br>
			It was then when I came with the decision to create <b>vonSchappler Gaming</b>, a new channel (which is currently our <b>vonSchapperTV</b>), a place where I play what I like, focusing on the story and lore of those games.
		</h4>
		<div class="ui divider"></div>
		<h1 class="ui big teal right ribbon label">Besides streams, do you do anything else?</h1><br>
		<h4>
			Well, it depends on what "else" we're talking about. If we stop to think, the whole scheme of overlays for stream/gamerecord of my channel, as well as everything that bears my mark is own creation.<br>
			Of course, I have to admit that nothing comes magically and what comes easy, goes away easy - in other words, I do not like being a showman and I plan long before doing anything... I also say that it is necessary to seek inspiration, references, ideas, suggestions. The union of all this is what gives you this result that I present TODAY to you.<br>
			Now, if by something "else" you are making reference to a formal job, the answer is "NO". I was a teacher, a researcher, a scientist - why not, I've already worked on several scientific research projects - and at the end of all that I realized something was always missing - VALORIZATION in what I did. I decided to work on my own, doing what I like, the way I like and value my work when I am providing this "service to you".
		</h4>
		<div class="ui divider"></div>
		<h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">Which softwares do you usually use<br>for streaming and overlay drawing?</h1><br>
		<h4>
			Secret!!!! (just kidding)<br>
			In fact, I'd rather not dwell on that. But who knows someday I share this secret?
		</h4>
		<div class="ui divider"></div>
		<h1 class="ui big teal right ribbon label">I remember you used the colors black and orange.<br>Where it comes the inspiration for the new color scheme?</h1><br>
		<h4>
			Well, as it is on my presentation card at the top of the page, I know a few things. In one of my researches (yes I study a lot on my own in search of something "different"), I met the SemanticUI framework, the same one I used to make this website and simply fell in love with colors offered by default in the framework. "Inverted" and "Teal" were very visually stunning and so I adopted these colors for my channel.
		</h4>
		<div class="ui divider"></div>
		<h1 class="ui big teal ribbon label">What kind of game do you like the most?<br>Which one do you least enjoy? Why?</h1><br>
		<h4>
			The answer to the first question is very complex to answer... It's hard to say I like RPG more or I like shooting games more. Each of the types of game I like (or play) has its strengths to attract me, as well as its negative points to leave me half "a bit afraid" to continue playing it.<br>
			Now, answering the second question: I can not deal with games that incite toxicity among players in any way. In general, games that have only competitive character are like that. I have a personal list of games that will NEVER be installed on my PC because they fit perfectly in the situation that I quoted, but I have no intentions to make this list public.
		</h4>
		<div class="ui divider"></div>
		<h1 class="ui big teal right ribbon label">Oh no! My question wasn't answered here.<br>What should I do?</h1><br>
		<h4>
			Unfortunately I can not keep this area very extensive, but if you have an unanswered question, you can look me up on social networks or contact me on my <a href="mailto:vonschappler.gaming@gmail.com?subject=von Schappler, answer me please...">e-mail</a> and I'll answer your question!
