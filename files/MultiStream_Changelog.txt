ChangeLog

v1.1.0
 - Fixed an issue that prevented the script to retrieve and load settings saved from UI.
 - Added a field to allow setting other casters to create the multi-stream link via UI.
   NOTE: Unlike setting the casters via command, filling this field will take effect ONLY
         after pressing "Saving Settings" on the Script UI. If this field is empty, no link
         will be created when using the command to create the link and user will need to
         fill in this "new field" inline with the creation link command, e.g.:
         !setmultion caster1 caster 2
 - Added a command to set multi-provider by id, instead of just setting them from the UI.
   NOTE: The id of multi-providers are displayed in the UI as a number next to the provider
         name, e.g.: "Provider_Name ( id = 1 )" can be set with the specific set command
         defined by using "!setcommand 1".
 - Added a small global cooldown (of 5secs) on multi display command to avoid double use of
   the multi link display by moderators and above perms hence those permission levels won't
   have cooldowns on the multi-stream display command.
 - Documentation was changed to reflect and detail changes made on the script usage. 

v1.0.5

 - Fixed small typos in the main code that could cause conflict in some variables.

 - Log files now create a more detailed log of script usage.
 - Fixed an issue that prevented the log inside the Chatbot to display
   correctly.

v1.0.3

 - Fixed an issue to display other casters added to the URL in the log file

   "auto" after !setmultigame, e.g.:
